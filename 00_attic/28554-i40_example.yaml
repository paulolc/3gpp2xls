    - KPI: 
        name: DelayE2EUlNs,
        type: E2E delay for network slice,
        title: Average e2e uplink delay for a network slice,
        section: 6.3.1.8.1 ,
        description: |
            This KPI describes the average e2e UL packet delay between the PSA
            UPF and the UE for a network slice. It is the weighted average packet
            delay from the time when an UL RLC SDU was scheduled at the UE until the
            time when the corresponding GTP PDU was received by the PSA UPF. The KPI
            type is MEAN in unit of 0.1 ms.
        Formula definition: |
            This KPI is the weighted average of UL packet delay between PSA UPF
            and UE, for all N3 interfaces (modelled by EP\_N3 MOIs) and N9
            interfaces (modelled by EP\_N9 MOIs) of all PSA UPFs supporting the
            network slice (modelled by NetworkSlice MOI) identified by the S-NSSAI.
            
            > This KPI is calculated in the equation below, where Wn3 and Wn9 are
            > the measurements for the weighted average, Wn3 is one of the
            > following:
            
            \- the data volume of UL GTP PDUs received by PSA UPF on the N3
            interface;
            
            \- the number of UL GTP PDUs received by PSA UPF on the N3 interface;
            
            \- any other types of weight defined by the consumer of KPI.
            
            > And Wn9 is one of the following:
            
            \- the data volume of UL GTP PDUs received by PSA UPF on the N9
            interface;
            
            \- the number of UL GTP PDUs received by PSA UPF on the N9 interface;
            
            \- any other types of weight defined by the consumer of KPI.

    - KPI:
        name: ULDelay\_NR\_SNw,
        type: Integrated uplink delay in RAN,
        title: Uplink delay in NG-RAN for a sub-network,
        section: 6.3.1.7.1 ,
        description: |
            This KPI describes the average packet transmission delay through the
            RAN part from the UE for a sub-network. It is used to evaluate delay
            performance of NG-RAN in uplink. It is the weighted average packet delay
            from when an UL RLC SDU was scheduled, as per the scheduling grant
            provided, until time when the corresponding PDCP SDU was sent to the
            core network from gNB-CU-UP. It is a time interval (0.1 ms). The KPI
            type is MEAN. This KPI can optionally be split into KPIs per QoS level
            (mapped 5QI or QCI in NR option 3) and per S-NSSAI.
        Formula definition: |
            Below are the equations for average "Integrated uplink delay in RAN"
            for this KPI on SubNetwork level. The "Integrated uplink delay in RAN"
            is the sum of average UL delay in gNB-CU-UP of the sub-network
            (ULDelay\_gNBCUUP\_SNw) and the average UL delay in gNB-DU of the
            sub-network (ULDelay\_gNBDU\_SNw):
            
            ULDelay\_NR\_SNw = ULDelay\_gNBCUUP\_SNw + ULDelay\_gNBDU\_SNw
            
            or optionally ULDelay\_ NR\_SNw.*QOS* = ULDelay\_gNBCUUP\_SNw.*QOS* +
            ULDelay\_gNBDU\_SNw.*QOS* where *QOS* identifies the target quality of
            service class.
            
            > or optionally ULDelay\_NR\_SNw.*SNSSAI* =
            > ULDelay\_gNBCUUP\_SNw.*SNSSAI* + ULDelay\_gNBDU\_SNw.*SNSSAI* where
            > *SNSSAI* identifies the S-NSSAI.

        section: 6.3.1.7.2 ,
        description: |
            This KPI describes the average packet transmission delay through the
            RAN part from the UE for a network slice subnet. It is used to evaluate
            delay performance of NG-RAN in uplink. It is the weighted average packet
            delay from when an UL RLC SDU was scheduled, as per the scheduling grant
            provided, until time when the corresponding PDCP SDU was sent to the
            core network from gNB-CU-UP. It is a time interval (0.1 ms). The KPI
            type is MEAN. This KPI can optionally be split into KPIs per QoS level
            (mapped 5QI or QCI in NR option 3) and per S-NSSAI.
        Formula definition: |
            Below is the equation for average “Integrated uplink delay in RAN”
            for this KPI on NetworkSliceSubNet level. The “Integrated uplink delay
            in RAN” for network slice subnet is the sum of average UL delay in
            gNB-CU-UP of the network slice subnet (ULDelay\_gNBCUUP\_Nss) and the
            average UL delay in gNB-DU of the network slice subnet
            (ULDelay\_gNBDU\_Nss):
            
            ULDelay\_NR\_Nss.*SNSSAI* = ULDelay\_gNBCUUP\_Nss.*SNSSAI* +
            ULDelay\_gNBDU\_Nss.*SNSSAI* where *SNSSAI* identifies the S-NSSAI that
            the network slice subnet supports.
