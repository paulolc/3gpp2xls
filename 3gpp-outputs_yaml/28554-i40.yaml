     flows with data in a buffer that was abnormally released, normalized
     with number of data session time units. The unit of this KPI is “active
     release / second”. The KPI type is MEAN.
  Formula: |-
    To measure QoS flow Retainability for a single QoS level (R1) is
     fairly straight forward.  
       
     ![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image81.png)![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image82.png)![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image82.png)  
     However to measure the QoS flow Retainability for UEs is not as straight
     forward. The measurement R1 is defined to look at the activity level of
     just one QoS level at the time, so to use this formula and measurements
     in an aggregated way to get QoS flow Retainability on UE level will not
     be accurate (e.g. for an UE with multiple QoS flows there might be QoS
     flows that are active at the same time, hence aggregating the QoS level
     measurements for session time will give a larger session time than the
     total UE session time. See picture below).  
       
       
     Hence a measurement QoS flow Retainability on UE level is defined (R2)
     to provide a measurement for the overall QoS flow Retainability.

     inverse of the average end-to-end User Plane (UP) latency of the network
     slice. In this KPI variant, latency are the only factor considered for
     evaluating the performance of network slice.

  Description: |-
    A KPI that shows the energy efficiency of network slices of type
     URLLC. The P<sub>ns</sub> for a network slice of type URLLC is the sum
     of UL and DL traffic volumes at N3 or N9 interface(s) on a per S-NSSAI
     basis multiplied by the inverse of the end-to-end User Plane (UP)
     latency of the network slice. In this KPI variant, data volume and
     latency are two factors considered for evaluating the performance of
     network slice. This KPI is applicable for the cases where, for example,
     the URLLC network slice is deployed and operators want to evaluate the
     Energy Efficiency of the slice at different periods of time, such as the
     busy hours in the morning and the idle hours in the mid night, in which
     both latency performance and the data volume performance can vary.

     ![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image109.emf)
     ![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image110.emf)
     w<sub>N3</sub> and w<sub>N9</sub> are the weight for DV<sub>N3</sub> and
     DV<sub>N9</sub> respectively. w<sub>N3</sub> and w<sub>N9</sub> can be
     decided according to the deployment of PSA UPF. For example, in cases
     where PSA UPF has only N9 tunnels, such as the ones described in TS
     23.501\[2\] clause 5.6.4 and clause 5.33.2.2, w<sub>N3</sub> can be set
     to 0 and W<sub>N9</sub> can be set to 1, so that only N9 interface is
     considered. In the cases where PSA UPF has only N3 tunnels,
     w<sub>N3</sub> can be set to 1 and w<sub>N9</sub> can be set to 0, so
     that only N3 interface is considered.
     This KPI is obtained by the product of the sum of the weighted UL and DL
     traffic data volumes at N3 interface(s) or N9 interface of the PSA UPF
     of the network slice multiplied by the inverse of the end-to-end User
     Plane (UP) latency of the network slice, divided by the energy
     consumption of the network slice. The unit of this KPI is
     bit/(0.1ms\*J).

  Remark: |-
    In case of redundant transmission paths for high reliability
     communication (TS 23.501 \[7\] clause 5.33.2), it is expected that the
     data volume is counted once. In particular:
     \- In case of Dual Connectivity based end to end Redundant User Plane
     Paths ( TS 23.501 \[7\] clause 5.33.2.1), in which a UE may set up two
     redundant PDU Sessions over the 5G network, the Data Volume related to
     only one PDU session is to be considered;
     \- In case of redundant transmission with two N3 tunnels between the PSA
     UPF and a single NG-RAN node (TS 23.501 \[7\] figure 5.33.2.2-1) which
     are associated with a single PDU Session, the Data Volume related to
     only one N3 tunnel is to be considered;
     \- In case of two N3 and N9 tunnels between NG-RAN and PSA UPF for
     redundant transmission ( TS 23.501 \[7\] figure 5.33.2.2-2) associated
     with a single PDU Session, the Data Volume related to only one of the
     multiple N3/N9 tunnels for redundant transmission connecting to PSA UPF
     is considered. The main reason for this is that, if the traffic is
     counted more than once, it will increase artificially the
     EEURLLC,DV,Latency KPI.
     The 3GPP management system in charge of collecting the data volume
     measurements listed here above shall consider them only once in case of
     redundant transmission over the N3/N9 interface.

    This KPI describes the Energy Consumption (EC) of the network slice
     It is obtained by summing up the Energy Consumption of all the Network
     Functions (EC<sub>NF</sub>) that compose the network slice. The unit of
     this KPI is J.
  Formula: |-
    ![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image130.emf)
     As a network slice may be composed of a RAN network slice subnet, a
     Transport Network (TN) network slice subnet and a 5GC network slice
     subnet, they all participate to the energy consumption of the network
     slice. However, the definition and way to measure the energy consumption
     of the TN segment is not in the scope of the present document.
     The definition of EC<sub>ns</sub> based on the following principles:
     \- For all gNBs in the network slice, clause 5.1.1.19.3 (PNF Energy
     consumption) of TS 28.552 \[6\] applies. This measurement is obtained
     according to the method defined in ETSI ES 202 336-12 \[10\] – clauses
     4.4.3.1, 4.4.3.4, Annex A;
     \- In case a 5GC NF is composed of Virtualized Network Functions (VNF)
     and/or Physical Network Functions (PNF), clause 6.7.3.1 of this document
     defines the NF Energy Consumption (EC);
     \- In case a NF is dedicated to a network slice, the energy consumption
     of the NF is entirely attributable to the network slice;
     \- In case a NF is shared between multiple network slices, the
     participation of the NF to the energy consumption of the network slice
     has to be estimated, as it can't be measured:
     \- In case of a gNB shared between multiple network slices, the energy
     consumption attributable to each network slice is estimated as a
     proportion of the total gNB energy consumption, where the proportion is
     calculated as the data volume of the network slice relatively to the
     total data volume carried by the gNB,
     \- In case of a AMF shared between multiple network slices, the energy
     consumption attributable to each network slice is estimated as a
     proportion of the total estimated AMF energy consumption, where the
     proportion is calculated as the mean number of registered subscribers of
     the network slice relatively to the overall mean number of registered
     subscribers of the AMF during the same time period (see TS 28.552 \[6\]
     clause 5.2.1.1 for the definition of the mean number of registered
     subscribers),
     \- In case of a SMF shared between multiple network slices, the energy
     consumption attributable to each network slice is estimated as a
     proportion of the total estimated SMF energy consumption, where the
     proportion is calculated as the mean number of PDU sessions of the
     network slice relatively to the overall mean number of PDU sessions of
     the SMF during the same time period (see TS 28.552 \[6\] clause 5.3.1.1
     for the definition of the mean number of PDU sessions),
     \- In case of a UPF shared between multiple slices, the energy
     consumption attributable to each network slice is estimated as a
     proportion of the total estimated UPF energy consumption, where the
     proportion is calculated as the data volume of the network slice
     relatively to the overall data volume of the UPF during the same time
     period.
     \- In case of a UPF with N3 interface(s), the data volume of the UPF is
     obtained by summing up, for all N3 interface(s), the number of octets of
     incoming GTP data packets on the N3 interface, from (R)AN to UPF (see TS
     28.552 \[6\] clause 5.4.1.3) and the number of octets of outgoing GTP
     data packets on the N3 interface, from UPF to (R)AN (see TS 28.552 \[6\]
     clause 5.4.1.4)
     \- In case of a PSA UPF with no N3 interface(s), the data volume of the
     UPF is obtained by summing up, for all N9 interface(s), the number of
     octets of incoming GTP data packets on the N9 interface for PSA UPF (see
     TS 28.552 \[6\] clause 5.4.4.2.3) and the number of octets of outgoing
     GTP data packets on the N9 interface for PSA UPF (see TS 28.552 \[6\]
     clause 5.4.4.2.4)
     \- The case of other 5GC NFs shared between network slices is not
     addressed in the present document.

  Remark: |-
    In case of redundant transmission paths over the N3 interface for

     is expected that the data volume is counted once. In particular:
     \- In case of Dual Connectivity based end to end Redundant User Plane
     Paths (see TS 23.501 \[7\] clause 5.33.2.1), in which a UE may set up
     two redundant PDU Sessions over the 5G network, the Data Volume related
     to only one PDU session is to be considered;
     \- In case of redundant transmission with two N3 tunnels between the PSA
     UPF and a single NG-RAN node (cf. TS 23.501 \[7\] figure 5.33.2.2-1)
     which are associated with a single PDU Session, the Data Volume related
     to only one N3 tunnel is to be considered;
     \- In case of two N3 and N9 tunnels between NG-RAN and PSA UPF for
     redundant transmission (see TS 23.501 \[7\] figure 5.33.2.2-2)
     associated with a single PDU Session, the Data Volume related to only
     one N3 tunnel is to be considered.
     For the measurement of the energy efficiency of the 5G core network, the
     3GPP management system in charge of collecting the data volume
     measurements listed here above shall consider them only once in case of
     redundant transmission over the N3 interface.
