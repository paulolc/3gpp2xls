this ratio will be used to quantify the impact of false paging
occasions, i.e. paging occasions that do not result in a UEs triggering
mobile terminated calls, on network side paging resource utilisation as
well as on UE’s power consumption : low rates will imply non optimal
network resource utilisation and high UE wake up rate (wake up here is
defined by Idle/Inactive to Connected mode transition) or equivalently
higher UE power consumption. This KPI is a percentage. The KPI type is
RATIO.

6.5 Retainability KPI
---------------------

### 6.5.1 QoS flow Retainability

#### 6.5.1.1 Definition

a\) QoSRetain\_R1, QoSRetain\_R2.

b\) This KPI shows how often an end-user abnormally loses a QoS flow
during the time the QoS flow is used. It is obtained by number of QoS
flows with data in a buffer that was abnormally released, normalized
with number of data session time units. The unit of this KPI is “active
release / second”. The KPI type is MEAN.

c\) To measure QoS flow Retainability for a single QoS level (R1) is
fairly straight forward.  
  
![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image81.png)![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image82.png)![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image82.png)  
However to measure the QoS flow Retainability for UEs is not as straight
forward. The measurement R1 is defined to look at the activity level of
just one QoS level at the time, so to use this formula and measurements
in an aggregated way to get QoS flow Retainability on UE level will not
be accurate (e.g. for an UE with multiple QoS flows there might be QoS
flows that are active at the same time, hence aggregating the QoS level
measurements for session time will give a larger session time than the
total UE session time. See picture below).  
  
  
Hence a measurement QoS flow Retainability on UE level is defined (R2)
to provide a measurement for the overall QoS flow Retainability.

d\) SubNetwork, NRCellCU

e\) The definition of the service provided by 5GS is QoS flows.

#### 6.5.1.2 Extended definition

The retainability rate is defined as:

To define (from a QoS flow Retainability point of view) if a QoS flow is
considered active or not, the QoS flows can be divided into two groups:

\- For QoS flows with bursty flow, a QoS flow is said to be active if
there is user data in the PDCP queue in any of the directions or if any
data (UL or DL) has been transferred during the last 100 ms.

\- For QoS flows with continuous flow, the QoS flow (and the UE) is seen
as being active in the context of this measurement as long as the UE is
in RRC connected state, and the session time is increased from the first
data transmission on the QoS flow until 100 ms after the last data
transmission on the QoS flow.

A particular QoS flow is defined to be of type continuous flow if the
mapped 5QI is any of {1, 2, 65, 66}.

\- For DRBs with bursty flow, a DRB is said to be active if any data (UL
or DL) has been transferred during the last 100 ms.

\- For DRBs with continuous flow, the DRB (and the UE) is seen as being
active in the context of this measurement as long as the UE is in RRC
connected state, and the session time is increased from the first data
transmission on the DRB until 100 ms after the last data transmission on
the DRB.

A particular DRB is defined to be of type continuous flow if the mapped
5QI is any of {1, 2, 65, 66}.

------------------------------

### 6.7.1 NG-RAN data Energy Efficiency (EE)

#### 6.7.1.1 Definition

a\) EE<sub>MN,DV</sub>.

b\) A KPI that shows mobile network data energy efficiency in
operational NG-RAN. Data Volume (DV) divided by Energy Consumption (EC)
of the considered network elements. The unit of this KPI is bit/J.

c\) EE<sub>MN,DV  
</sub>

> ![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image97.png) - for non-split gNBs;
>
> ![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image98.png) - for split gNBs;

d\) SubNetwork

e\) The Data Volume (in kbits) is obtained by measuring amount of DL/UL
PDCP SDU bits of the considered network elements over the measurement
period. For split-gNBs, the Data Volume is calculated per Interface
(F1-U, Xn-U, X2-U). The Energy Consumption (in kWh) is obtained by
measuring the PEE.Energy of the considered network elements over the
same period of time. The samples are aggregated at the NG-RAN node
level. The 3GPP management system responsible for the management of the
gNB (single or multiple vendor gNB) shall be able to collect PEE
measurements data from all PNFs in the gNB, in the same way as the other
PM measurements.

where:

\- ‘Performance of network slice’ (P<sub>ns</sub>) is defined per type
of network slice;

\- ‘Energy Consumption of network slice’ (EC<sub>ns</sub>) is defined
independently from any type of network slice.

For one unit of EC<sub>ns</sub>, the higher P<sub>ns</sub> is, the

efficient the network slice is.

#### 6.7.2.2 Energy efficiency of eMBB network slice

a\) EE<sub>eMBB,DV</sub>

b\) A KPI that shows the energy efficiency of network slices of type

![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image100.emf)

, where *SNSSAI* identifies the S-NSSAI.

Paths (cf. TS 23.501 \[7\] clause 5.33.2.1), in which a UE may set up
two redundant PDU Sessions over the 5G network, the Data Volume related
to only one PDU session is to be considered;

UPF and a single NG-RAN node (cf. TS 23.501 \[7\] figure 5.33.2.2-1)

to only one N3 tunnel is to be considered;

\- In case of two N3 and N9 tunnels between NG-RAN and PSA UPF for
redundant transmission (cf. TS 23.501 \[7\] figure 5.33.2.2-2)

one N3 tunnel is to be considered.

For the measurement of the energy efficiency of the 5G core network, the
3GPP management system in charge of collecting the data volume
measurements listed here above shall consider them only once in case of
redundant transmission over the N3 interface.

#### 6.7.2.3 Energy efficiency of URLLC network slice

##### 6.7.2.3.1 Introduction

This KPI is defined with two variants.

##### 6.7.2.3.2 Based on latency of the network slice

a\) EE<sub>URLLC,Latency</sub>

b\) A KPI that shows the energy efficiency of network slices of type
URLLC. The P<sub>ns</sub> for a network slice of type URLLC is the
inverse of the average end-to-end User Plane (UP) latency of the network
slice. In this KPI variant, latency are the only factor considered for
evaluating the performance of network slice.

![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image105.emf)

, where ‘Network slice mean latency’ is defined as the average
end-to-end User Plane (UP) latency of the network slice, and where the
average end-to-end User Plane (UP) latency for one S-NSSAI is defined
by:

![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image106.emf)

This KPI is obtained by the inverse of the average end-to-end User Plane
(UP) latency of the network slice divided by the energy consumption of
the network slice. The unit of this KPI is (0.1ms \* J)<sup>-1</sup>.

c\)

![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image107.emf)

d\) NetworkSlice

##### 6.7.2.3.3 Based on both latency and Data Volume (DV) of the network slice

a\) EE<sub>URLLC,DV,Latency</sub>

b\) A KPI that shows the energy efficiency of network slices of type
URLLC. The P<sub>ns</sub> for a network slice of type URLLC is the sum
of UL and DL traffic volumes at N3 or N9 interface(s) on a per S-NSSAI
basis multiplied by the inverse of the end-to-end User Plane (UP)
latency of the network slice. In this KPI variant, data volume and
latency are two factors considered for evaluating the performance of
network slice. This KPI is applicable for the cases where, for example,
the URLLC network slice is deployed and operators want to evaluate the
Energy Efficiency of the slice at different periods of time, such as the
busy hours in the morning and the idle hours in the mid night, in which
both latency performance and the data volume performance can vary.

![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image108.emf)

where

![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image109.emf)

![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image110.emf)

w<sub>N3</sub> and w<sub>N9</sub> are the weight for DV<sub>N3</sub> and
DV<sub>N9</sub> respectively. w<sub>N3</sub> and w<sub>N9</sub> can be
decided according to the deployment of PSA UPF. For example, in cases
where PSA UPF has only N9 tunnels, such as the ones described in TS
23.501\[2\] clause 5.6.4 and clause 5.33.2.2, w<sub>N3</sub> can be set
to 0 and W<sub>N9</sub> can be set to 1, so that only N9 interface is
considered. In the cases where PSA UPF has only N3 tunnels,
w<sub>N3</sub> can be set to 1 and w<sub>N9</sub> can be set to 0, so
that only N3 interface is considered.

This KPI is obtained by the product of the sum of the weighted UL and DL
traffic data volumes at N3 interface(s) or N9 interface of the PSA UPF
of the network slice multiplied by the inverse of the end-to-end User
Plane (UP) latency of the network slice, divided by the energy
consumption of the network slice. The unit of this KPI is
bit/(0.1ms\*J).

c\)

![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image111.emf)

d\) NetworkSlice

e\) In case of redundant transmission paths for high reliability
communication (TS 23.501 \[7\] clause 5.33.2), it is expected that the
data volume is counted once. In particular:

\- In case of Dual Connectivity based end to end Redundant User Plane
Paths ( TS 23.501 \[7\] clause 5.33.2.1), in which a UE may set up two
redundant PDU Sessions over the 5G network, the Data Volume related to
only one PDU session is to be considered;

\- In case of redundant transmission with two N3 tunnels between the PSA
UPF and a single NG-RAN node (TS 23.501 \[7\] figure 5.33.2.2-1) which
are associated with a single PDU Session, the Data Volume related to
only one N3 tunnel is to be considered;

\- In case of two N3 and N9 tunnels between NG-RAN and PSA UPF for
redundant transmission ( TS 23.501 \[7\] figure 5.33.2.2-2) associated
with a single PDU Session, the Data Volume related to only one of the
multiple N3/N9 tunnels for redundant transmission connecting to PSA UPF
is considered. The main reason for this is that, if the traffic is
counted more than once, it will increase artificially the
EEURLLC,DV,Latency KPI.

The 3GPP management system in charge of collecting the data volume
measurements listed here above shall consider them only once in case of
redundant transmission over the N3/N9 interface.

![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image112.emf)

, where *SNSSAI* identifies the S-NSSAI.

the network slice divided by the energy consumption of the network
slice. The unit of this KPI is user/J.

##### 6.7.2.4.2 Based on the number of active UEs in the network slice

a\) EE<sub>MIoT,ActiveUEs</sub>

b\) A KPI that shows the energy efficiency of network slices of type

is the mean number of active UEs of the network slice.

![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image114.emf)

Transport Network (TN) network slice subnet and a 5GC network slice
subnet, they all participate to the energy consumption of the network
slice. However, the definition and way to measure the energy consumption
of the TN segment is not in the scope of the present document.

The definition of EC<sub>ns</sub> based on the following principles:

\- For all gNBs in the network slice, clause 5.1.1.19.3 (PNF Energy
consumption) of TS 28.552 \[6\] applies. This measurement is obtained
according to the method defined in ETSI ES 202 336-12 \[10\] – clauses
4.4.3.1, 4.4.3.4, Annex A;

\- In case a 5GC NF is composed of Virtualized Network Functions (VNF)
and/or Physical Network Functions (PNF), clause 6.7.3.1 of this document
defines the NF Energy Consumption (EC);

\- In case a NF is dedicated to a network slice, the energy consumption
of the NF is entirely attributable to the network slice;

\- In case a NF is shared between multiple network slices, the
participation of the NF to the energy consumption of the network slice
has to be estimated, as it can't be measured:

\- In case of a gNB shared between multiple network slices, the energy
consumption attributable to each network slice is estimated as a
proportion of the total gNB energy consumption, where the proportion is
calculated as the data volume of the network slice relatively to the
total data volume carried by the gNB,

\- In case of a AMF shared between multiple network slices, the energy
consumption attributable to each network slice is estimated as a
proportion of the total estimated AMF energy consumption, where the
proportion is calculated as the mean number of registered subscribers of
the network slice relatively to the overall mean number of registered
subscribers of the AMF during the same time period (see TS 28.552 \[6\]
clause 5.2.1.1 for the definition of the mean number of registered
subscribers),

\- In case of a SMF shared between multiple network slices, the energy
consumption attributable to each network slice is estimated as a
proportion of the total estimated SMF energy consumption, where the
proportion is calculated as the mean number of PDU sessions of the
network slice relatively to the overall mean number of PDU sessions of
the SMF during the same time period (see TS 28.552 \[6\] clause 5.3.1.1
for the definition of the mean number of PDU sessions),

\- In case of a UPF shared between multiple slices, the energy
consumption attributable to each network slice is estimated as a
proportion of the total estimated UPF energy consumption, where the
proportion is calculated as the data volume of the network slice
relatively to the overall data volume of the UPF during the same time
period.

\- In case of a UPF with N3 interface(s), the data volume of the UPF is
obtained by summing up, for all N3 interface(s), the number of octets of
incoming GTP data packets on the N3 interface, from (R)AN to UPF (see TS
28.552 \[6\] clause 5.4.1.3) and the number of octets of outgoing GTP
data packets on the N3 interface, from UPF to (R)AN (see TS 28.552 \[6\]
clause 5.4.1.4)

\- In case of a PSA UPF with no N3 interface(s), the data volume of the
UPF is obtained by summing up, for all N9 interface(s), the number of
octets of incoming GTP data packets on the N9 interface for PSA UPF (see
TS 28.552 \[6\] clause 5.4.4.2.3) and the number of octets of outgoing
GTP data packets on the N9 interface for PSA UPF (see TS 28.552 \[6\]
clause 5.4.4.2.4)

\- The case of other 5GC NFs shared between network slices is not
addressed in the present document.

Paths (see TS 23.501 \[7\] clause 5.33.2.1), in which a UE may set up
two redundant PDU Sessions over the 5G network, the Data Volume related
to only one PDU session is to be considered;

\- In case of redundant transmission with two N3 tunnels between the PSA
UPF and a single NG-RAN node (cf. TS 23.501 \[7\] figure 5.33.2.2-1)
which are associated with a single PDU Session, the Data Volume related
to only one N3 tunnel is to be considered;

\- In case of two N3 and N9 tunnels between NG-RAN and PSA UPF for
redundant transmission (see TS 23.501 \[7\] figure 5.33.2.2-2)
associated with a single PDU Session, the Data Volume related to only
one N3 tunnel is to be considered.

For the measurement of the energy efficiency of the 5G core network, the
3GPP management system in charge of collecting the data volume
measurements listed here above shall consider them only once in case of
redundant transmission over the N3 interface.

6.8 Reliability KPI

########  Annex A (informative): Use cases for end to end KPIs

A.1 Use case for end-to-end latency measurements of 5G network-related KPI
==========================================================================

The end-to-end latency is an important performance parameter for
operating 5G network. In some scenarios (e.g. uRLLC), if end-to-end
latency is insufficient, the 5G network customer cannot obtain
guaranteed network performance provided by the network operator. So it
is necessary to define end-to-end latency of network related measurement
to evaluate whether the end-to-end latency that network customer
requested has been satisfied. A procedure is invoked by network
management system and is used:

\- to update the CSMF/NSMF with the end-to-end latency parameter for
monitoring;

\- to inform the network customer/network operator the end-to-end
latency;

\- to make CSMF/NSMF aware if the end-to-end latency can meet network
customer’s service requirement.

If high end-to-end latency are measured, it is also of benefit to
pinpoint where in the chain from application to UE that the latency
occurs.

A.2 Use case for number of registered subscribers of single network-slice related KPI
=====================================================================================

Number (mean and max) of registered subscribers of single network slice
can be used to describe the amount of subscribers that are successfully
registered, it can reflect the usage of network slice , It is useful to
evaluate accessibility performance provided by one single network slice
which may trigger the lifecycle management of the network slice, this
kind of KPI is valuable especially when network functions (e.g. AMF) are
shared between different network slice . This KPI is focusing on both
network and user view.

A.3 Use case for upstream/downstream throughput for one-single-network-slice-related KPI
========================================================================================

Measuring throughput is useful to evaluate system load of end to end
network slice. If the throughput of the specific network slice cannot
meet the performance requirement, some actions need to be performed to
the network slice e.g. reconfiguration, capacity relocation. So it is
necessary to define the IP throughput for one single network slice .
This KPI is focusing on network and user view.

A.4 Use case for mean PDU sessions number in network slice 
==========================================================

It is necessary to evaluate the mean or maximum PDU session number in
the network slice to indicate system load level. For example, if the
mean or maximum value of the PDU sessions is high, maybe the system
capacity should be increased. This KPI is focusing on network view.

A.5 Use case for virtualised resource utilization of network-slice-related KPI
==============================================================================

It is necessary to evaluate the current utilization of virtualised
resources (e.g. memory and storage utilization) that a network slice is
occupied. If the utilization is larger or smaller than the threshold,
maybe some scale in/out operations will be made by the management
system. This KPI is focusing on network and user view.

A.6 Use case for 5GS registration success rate of one single-network-slice-related KPI
======================================================================================

It is necessary to evaluate accessibility performance provided by 5GS.
5GS registration for a UE is important when they have registered to the
network slice . If users or subscribers cannot register to the network
slice , they cannot access any network services in the network slice .
This KPI is focusing on network view.

A.7 Use case for RAN UE throughput-related KPI
==============================================

The UE perceived throughput in NG-RAN is an important performance
parameter for operating 5G network. If the UE throughput of the NR cell
cannot meet the performance requirement, some actions need to be
performed to the network, e.g. reconfiguration or capacity increase. So
it is necessary to define UE throughput KPI to evaluate whether the
end-users are satisfied. The KPI covers volume large enough to make the
throughput measurement relevant, i.e. excluding data volume of the last
or only slot.

The UE throughput KPI covers also "NR option 3" scenarios. Then the gNB
is "connected" towards the EPC, and not towards 5GC.

It is proposed to allow the KPI separated based on mapped 5QI (or for
QCI in case of NR option 3).

When network slicing is supported by the NG-RAN, multiple network slices
may be supported. The UL and DL UE throughput for each network slice is
then of importance to the operator to pinpoint a specific performance
problem.

A.8 Use case for QoS flow retainability-related KPI
===================================================

QoS flow is the key and limited resource for 5GS to deliver services.
The release of the QoS flow needs to be monitored. QoS flow
retainability is a key performance indicator of how often an end-user
abnormally losing a QoS flow during the time the QoS flow is used. This
key performance indicator is of great importance to estimate the end
users’ experiences.

A.9 Use case for DRB accessibility-related KPIs
===============================================

In providing services to end-users, the first step is to get access to
the service. First after access to the service has been performed, the
service can be used.

The service provided by NG-RAN is the DRB. For the DRB to be
successfully setup it is also necessary to setup an RRC connection and
an NG signalling connection.

If an end user cannot access a service, it is hard to charge for the
service. Also, if it happens often that an end-user cannot access the
provided service, the end-user might change wireless subscription
provider, i.e. loss of income for the network operator. Hence, to have a
good accessibility of the services is important from a business point of
view.

The DRB accessibility KPIs require the following 5 measurements:

\- DRB connection setup success rate.

\- DRB setup success rate.

The success rate for RRC connection setup and for NG signalling
connection setup shall exclude setups with establishment cause
mo-Signalling, since these phases/procedures occur when there is no
request to setup a DRB.

The KPIs are available per mapped 5QI and per S-NSSAI, and assist the
network operator with information about the accessibility provided to
their 5G network customers.

A.10 Use case for mobility KPIs
===============================

When a service is used it is important that it is not interrupted or
aborted. One of the fault cases in a radio system for this is
handovers/mobility.

If a mobility KPI is not considered OK, then the network operator can
investigate which steps that are required to improve the mobility
towards their services.

These KPIs can be used for observing the impact on end-users of mobility
in NG-RAN and towards other system.

A.11 Use case for DRB retainability related KPI
===============================================

DRB is the key and limited resource for 5GS to deliver services. Once a
QoS flow reaches a gNB it will trigger setup of a new DRB or it will be
mapped to an existing DRB. The decision on how to map QoS flows into new
or existing DRBs is taken at the CU-CP. CU-CP also defines one set of
QoS parameters (one 5QI) for the DRB. If a QoS flow is mapped to an
existing DRB, the packets belonging to that QoS flow are not treated
with the 5QI of the QoS flow, but they are treated with the mapped 5QI
of the DRB.

The release of the DRB needs to be monitored, so that abnormal releases
while the UE is considered in an active transfer shall be logged. DRB
retainability is a key performance indicator of how often an end-user
abnormally loses a DRB during the time the DRB is actively used. This
key performance indicator is of great important to estimate the end
users’ experiences. DRBs with bursty flow are considered active if any
data (UL or DL) has been transferred during the last 100 ms. DRBs with
continuous flow are seen as active DRBs in the context of this
measurement as long as the UE is in RRC connected state. A particular
DRB is defined to be of type continuous flow if the mapped 5QI is any of
{1, 2, 65, 66}.

The key performance indicator shall monitor the DRB retainability for
each used mapped 5QI value, as well as for the used S-NSSAI(s). DRBs
used in 3GPP option 3 shall not be covered by this KPI. For the case
when a DRB have multiple QoS flows mapped and active, when a QoS flow is
released it will not be counted as a DRB release (DRB still active) in
this KPI.

A.12 Use case for PDU session establishment success rate of one network slice (S-NSSAI) related KPI
===================================================================================================

It is necessary to evaluate accessibility performance provided by 5GS.
PDU session Establishment for a UE is important when it has registered
to the network slice. If users or subscribers cannot establish PDU
sessions in slice instance, they cannot access any network services in
the network slice. This KPI is focusing on network view.

A.13 Use case for integrated downlink latency in RAN
====================================================

Following figure captured in clause 4.2.3, 3GPP TS 23.501\[x\]
illustrates the 5G system architecture. The end to end downlink latency
should be measured from Data Network to UE, of which the latency from
RAN to UE is an important part for the latency of this section is
closely related to NG-RAN.

The integrated downlink latency in RAN is a key performance parameter
for evaluating the packet delay in RAN for QoS monitoring. This KPI is
also an important part of the end-to-end network latency for SLA
assurance.

A.14 Use case for PDU session Establishment success rate of one single-network-slice instance-related KPI
=========================================================================================================

It is necessary to evaluate PDU session establishment time, it can be
used to analyse the network service difference between different RAN
locations in one area, which can be used for management area division.
This KPI is focusing on network view.

A.15 Use case for QoS flow retainability-related KPI
====================================================

QoS Flow is the key and limited resource for 5GS to deliver services.
The release of the QoS flow needs to be monitored. QoS Flow drop ratio
is a key performance indicator of how often an end-user is abnormally
losing a bearer. This key performance indicator is of great importance
to estimate the end users’ experiences.

The KPI shall be available per QoS group.

From QoS perspective it is important to focus also on call duration as
in some cases wrong quality perceived by the end user is not fully
reflected by drop ratio nor retainability KPI. Typical case is when due
to poor radio conditions the end user redials (the call was terminated
normally) to the same party to secure the quality. But in this case the
drop ratio KPI will not show any degradation. Secondly, although the
call is dropped the end user may or may not redial depending on dropped
call duration compared to the case when the call would be normally
released. It is therefore highly recommended to monitor distribution of
duration of normally and abnormally released calls.

A.16 Use case for 5G Energy Efficiency (EE) KPI
===============================================

Assessment of Energy Efficiency in network is very important for
operators willing to control their OPEX and, in particular, their
network energy OPEX.

5G energy efficiency can be addressed from various perspectives:

\- NG-RAN.

Mobile Network data Energy Efficiency (EE<sub>MN,DV</sub>) is the ratio
between the performance indicator (DV<sub>MN</sub>) and the energy
consumption (EC<sub>MN</sub>) when assessed during the same time frame,
see ETSI ES 203 228 \[8\] clause 3.1 and clause 5.3.

![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image153.png)![](./attachments/28552-i50/media/image153.png)

where EE<sub>MN,DV</sub> is expressed in bit/J.

Assessment of EE<sub>MN,DV</sub> needs the collection of both Data
Volumes (DV) and Energy Consumption (EC) of 5G Network Functions (NF).
How this EE KPI can be applied to NG-RAN is specified in clause 4.1 of
TS 28.310 \[9\].

Before the network operator takes any action to save network energy
OPEX, the network operator needs to know the energy efficiency of its 5G
network.

This KPI needs to be used for observing the impact of NG-RAN on data
energy efficiency of 5G access networks.

\- Network slices.

In a Network Slice as a Service (NSaaS) model, a Network Slice Customer
(NSC) may ask to its Network Slice Provider (NSP) a network slice with
certain characteristics, among which the expected EE of the network
slice. It is therefore required that a standardized definition of EE
KPIs exists, per type of network slice, and that such EE KPIs can be
measured and delivered by Network Slice Providers.

A.17 Use case for PFCP session established success rate of one network and one network slice instance-related KPI
=================================================================================================================

It is necessary to evaluate the PFCP session established success rate of
one network and one network slice instance-related KPI. It can be used
to analyse the quality for the N4 interface connection between different
vendor’s SMF and UPF related to one network or one network silce. The
KPI is very useful for the industry customer’s Park area and N4
interface decouping deployment for operrators. And this KPI is mainly
focusing on network view.

A.18 Use case for end-to-end reliability measurements of 5G network-related KPI
===============================================================================

The end-to-end reliability is an important performance parameter for
operating 5G network. In some scenarios (e.g. uRLLC), if end-to-end
reliability is insufficient, the 5G network customer cannot obtain
guaranteed network performance provided by the network operator. So it
is necessary to assess end-to-end reliability of network utilizing the
packet delivery success rate measurements defined in clauses
6.8.2,6.8.3,6.8.4 and 6.8.5.The same can be used to determine the end to
end reliability of a slice.

A.19 Use case for average UE achievable air-interface efficiency
================================================================

The average UE achievable air-interface efficiency could provide
operators with the channel status considering both channel rank and
quality simultaneously. It can help operators to evaluate the overall
channel state and the efficiency of the cell when Massive MIMO is
enabled. There are several CQI tables defined in TS 38.214\[14\], the
KPI can be calculated by using all the CQI tables or some of CQI tables
with the same BLER value.

A.20 Use case for 5G VN group measurements related KPIs.
========================================================

It is necessary to evaluate the end-to-end network KPIs on 5G VN group
level to evaluate the performance of 5G LAN-type services for provided
consistence of group UE experience. The 5G VN group measurements KPIs
require the follow measurements:

\- The 5G VN internal group status, calculated by group member
registration/de-registration success rate of 5G VN group, internal Group
ID identifies a 5G VN group communication, as specified in TS 23.501
\[4\].

\- The 5G VN internal group session establishment success rate,
calculated by the PDU session establishment success rate related to a 5G
VN group, internal Group ID identifies a 5G VN group communication, as
specified in TS 23.501 \[4\].

\- The duration of 5G VN internal group communication, counted by the
sum of duration of individual PDU sessions within the 5G VN group
communication, internal Group ID identifies a 5G VN group communication,
as specified in TS 23.501 \[4\].

To monitor the status of 5G VN Group, 5G VN Group level session
establishment success rate and the duration of 5G VN group communication
can assist the network operator with information about the 5G LAN-type
services provided to their 5G network customers. These KPIs are focusing
on network view.

A.21 Use case for air interface average efficiency based on MCS for NRCellDU
============================================================================

The air interface average efficiency KPI based on MCS could provide
operators with the channel status and efficiency considering spatial
multiplexing under both SU MIMO and MU MIMO scenarios when Massive MIMO
is enabled. The MCS distribution can be performed separately in uplink
and downlink, so the corresponding KPIs can also evaluate the
performance of air interface separately. There are several MCS tables
defined in TS 38.214 \[14\] both for uplink and downlink, the KPIs can
be calculated by using all the MCS tables or some of MCS tables with the
same BLER value.
