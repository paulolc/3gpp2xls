 1 Scope
=======

This document specifies the performance measurements for 5G networks
including network slicing. Performance measurements for NG-RAN are
defined in this document (clause 5.1), and some L2 measurement
definitions are inherited from TS 38.314 \[29\]. The performance
measurements for 5GC are all defined in this document (clause 5.2 to
5.6). Related KPIs are defined to those measurements are defined in TS
28.554 \[8\].

The performance measurements for NG-RAN applies also to NR option 3 in
many cases, but not to the RRC connection related measurements which are
handled by E-UTRAN for NR option 3 (those are measured according to TS
32.425 \[9\] and related KPIs in TS 32.451 \[10\]).

The performance measurements are defined based on the measurement
template as described in TS 32.404 \[3\].

4 Concepts and overview
=======================

4.1 Performance indicators
--------------------------

Performance indicators are the performance data aggregated over a group
of NFs, such as, for example, average latency along the network slice.
The Performance Indicators can be derived from the performance
measurements collected at the NFs that belong to the group. The
aggregation method is identified in the performance indicator definition

Performance indicators at the network slice subnet level can be derived
from the performance measurements *collected at the NFs that belong to
the network slice subnets or to the constituent network slice subnets.
The* performance indicators at the *network slice subnet* level *can be
made available via the corresponding performance management service for
network slice subnet.*

The performance indicators at the network slice level, can be derived
from the *network slice subnet level Performance Indicators collected at
the constituent network slice subnets and/or NFs. The* network slice
*level performance indicators can be made available via the
corresponding performance management service for* network slice*.*

When providing a communication service to a tenant, the performance
indicators can be derived from corresponding performance indicators
related to network slice, *network slice subnet* and NFs and they can be
made available via the corresponding performance management service,
consumed by a tenant. Tenant(s) may be associated with S-NSSAI or
sNSSAIList in which case, the performance indicators are split into
subcounters per S-NSSAI for individual tenant.

4.2 Filters and filter naming
-----------------------------

### 4.2.0 General

In case a performance measurement is defined for more than one
sub-counter, it is convenient to use *Filter* to define the performance
measurement of interest.

### 4.2.1 Filters

Performance measurements may be sub-divided by use of applicable filters
to form new Performance measurements (or sub counters). Any applicable
*Filter(s)* are identified in each performance measurements definition.
Performance measurements may also be defined without any applied
*Filter*.

When no *Filter* is applied the performance measurement should exclude
the *Filter* extension.

Example of possible *Filter* values:

\- 5QI

\- QCI

\- SNSSAI, where SNSSAI represents the S-NSSAI

\- PLMN, where PLMN represents the PLMN ID

### 4.2.2 Filter naming

For the Performance measurements that indicate *Filters*, the resulting
Performance measurement name will take the form: Performance
measurement\_*Filter*

If combination of *Filters* is used the name will take the form:
Performance measurement\_*Filter1\_Filter2*

If no *Filter* is used the name will take the form: Performance
measurement

Example: DRB.PdcpF1DelayDl\_*Filter,* Where *Filter* is a combination of
*PLMN* and *5QI* and *SNSSAI*.

\- Single *Filter* value applied: DRB.PdcpF1DelayDl\_*Filter1*, where
*Filter* could be any of the possible *Filter* value defined for the
performance measurement:  

\- Sub counter name: DRB.PdcpF1DelayDl.*5QI*

\- Multiple (two) *Filter* values applied:
DRB.PdcpF1DelayDl\_*Filter1\_Filter2*, where *Filter1* and *Filter2*
could be any of the possible *Filter* value defined for the performance
measurement:  

\- Sub counter name: DRB.PdcpF1DelayDl.*PLMN.5QI.*

\- No *Filter* value applied: Counter name: DRB.PdcpF1DelayDl

For *Filters* the separator '\_' is used to append the filter name(s) to
the measurement name. For multiple *Filters* the order in the resulting
name is not important.

5 Performance measurements for 5G network functions
===================================================

5.1 Performance measurements for gNB
------------------------------------

### 5.1.0 Relation to RAN L2 measurement specification

When it comes to Layer 2 measurement definitions, some of the L2
measurement definitions used in the present document are referring to TS
38.314 \[29\]. The L2 measurement definitions in TS 38.314 \[29\] and in
the present document have some differences:

\- The measurement definitions in TS 38.314 \[29\] are often defined to
be reported 'per UE or per DRB', to support MDT and Trace use cases.

\- The measurements defined in the present document define L2
measurements that is aggregated and often reported per a Managed Object
class (e.g. NRCellDU).

Thus, for those L2 measurements, the definition in TS 38.314 \[29\] is
re-used in the present document, but without requirement of 'per UE or
per DRB' reporting to be performed.

### 5.1.1 Performance measurements valid for all gNB deployment scenarios

#### 5.1.1.1 Packet Delay

##### 5.1.1.1.1 Average delay DL air-interface

a\) This measurement provides the average (arithmetic mean) time it

direction. The measurement is calculated per PLMN ID and per QoS level
(mapped 5QI or QCI in NR option 3) and per supported S-NSSAI.

b\) DER (n=1)

c\) This measurement is obtained as: sum of (point in time when the last
part of an RLC SDU packet was sent to the UE which was consequently
confirmed by reception of HARQ ACK from UE for UM mode or point in time
when the last part of an RLC SDU packet was sent to the UE which was
consequently confirmed by reception of RLC ACK for AM mode, minus time
when corresponding RLC SDU part arriving at MAC layer) divided by total
number of RLC SDUs transmitted to UE successfully. The measurement is
performed per PLMN ID and per QoS level (mapped 5QI or QCI in NR option
3) and per supported S-NSSAI.

d\) Each measurement is a real representing the mean delay in 0.1
millisecond. The number of measurements is equal to the number of PLMNs
multiplied by the number of QoS levels or multiplied by the number of
supported S-NSSAIs.

SDU packet was sent to the UE which was consequently confirmed by
reception of RLC ACK for AM mode, minus the time when corresponding RLC
SDU part arriving at MAC layer; and 2) incrementing the corresponding
bin with the delay range where the result of 1) falls into by 1 for the
counters. If the RLC SDU needs retransmission (for Acknowledged Mode)
the delay will still include only one contribution (the original one) to
this measurement. The measurement is performed per PLMN ID and per QoS
level (mapped 5QI or QCI in NR option 3) and per supported S-NSSAI.

d\) Each measurement is an integer representing the number of RLC SDU

##### 5.1.1.3.7 Average DL UE buffered Throughput per DRB

a\) This measurement provides the average down link buffered UE
throughput per DRB on NRCellCU. The DRBs are mapped with the same 5QI
for NR SA or mapped with the same QCI for EN-DC. This measurement is
intended for throughput per UE and bearer independent of traffic
patterns and packet size. The measurement is based on Desired buffer
size communicated within DDDS from DU to CU UP and is intended for
services with burst duration spanning over the time interval of a couple
of consequent DDDSs. For very bursty traffic with burst duration within
the interval of one DDDS the measured values can be unprecise and cannot
be compared across vendors. Initial buffering time in CU and on F1,
meant as time interval the first PDCP SDU of the new burst is received
in CU until this first part is received in DU, is excluded. The
monitoring is supported also in DC scenario and in NSA option3a and 3x.

b\) DER(N=1);

c\) This measurement is obtained by the following formula for a
measurement period:

$$\\frac{\\sum\_{}^{}\\text{ThroughputVolume}}{\\sum\_{}^{}\\text{ThroughputTime}}\\ \\lbrack\\text{kbits}/s\\rbrack$$

where each ThroughputVolume and ThroughputTime is intended to represent
one DL burst as explained in the Fig. 5.1.1.3.7-1, Fig. 5.1.1.3.7-3,
Fig. 5.1.1.3.7-5 and Table 5.1.1.3.7-2, Table 5.1.1.3.7-4, Table
5.1.1.3.7-6 for DRB (SA, NSA option 3a), split DRB (DC), split DRB (NSA
option 3x), respectively. Separate counters are maintained for each
mapped 5QI (or QCI for option 3).

receipt of UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND \[11\] from AMF and the sending of
a RRCReconfiguration message triggering the Uu handover from the source
NG-RAN to the UE over a granularity period using DER, for legacy
handovers. The high tide mark of this time will be stored in a gauge,
the gauge shall be reinitialised at the beginning of each granularity
period.

It is assumed that the UE context is available in the source gNB. The
following events are counted:

1\) On reception at the source of NGAP UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND \[11\]
from AMF indicating an unsuccessful inter gNB handover,

2\) On reception of RrcReestablishmentRequest \[20\] where the
reestablishmentCause is handoverFailure, from the UE in the source gNB,
where the reestablishment occurred in the source gNB;

> 3\) On expiry of a Handover Execution supervision timer in the source
> gNB;

4\) On reception of XnAP RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT REQUEST \[13\] in the
source gNB, when the reestablishment occurred in another gNB.

The failure causes for NGAP UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND are listed in
\[11\]. An event increments the relevant subcounter by 1. For
MM.HoExeInterSSBFail.UeCtxtRelCmd, an event increments the relevant
subcounter per failure cause by 1.

As one handover failure might cause more than one of the above events,
duplicates need to be filtered out.

> a\) This measurement provides the average value of allocated MIMO
> layers on the uplink per PRB per cell, for MIMO scenario within the
> measurement period.

b\) SI.

c\) This measurement is obtained by computing the average value of
scheduled MIMO layers among all used PRBs that are used within the
measurement period in the cell. The average value is obtained by this
formula:

$L\_{\\text{aveUL}} = \\frac{\\sum\_{\\forall j}^{}{\\sum\_{\\forall k}^{}\\left\\{ {M1}\_{\\text{kj}}\\left( T \\right)\*L\_{\\text{kj}}\\left( T \\right) \\right\\}}}{\\sum\_{\\forall j}^{}{\\sum\_{\\forall k}^{}\\left\\{ {M1}\_{\\text{kj}}\\left( T \\right) \\right\\}}}$,

where *L*<sub>aveUL</sub> denotes the average value of scheduled MIMO
layers per PRB per cell on the UL. *T* denotes the measurement period
(e.g. 1 hour). And *j* denotes the sampling occasion *j* (e.g. 1
symbol). And *k* denotes the number of kinds of MIMO layers (e.g. 2
kinds). *L*<sub>kj</sub>(*T*) denotes the number of MIMO layers (e.g. 1
layers, 4layers, etc.) scheduled for traffic transmission at sampling
occasion *j*. *M*1<sub>kj</sub>(*T*) denotes the number of PUSCH PRBs
used for transmission corresponding to *L*<sub>kj</sub>(*T*), at
sampling occasion *j*. For example, a cell has 10 PRBs in total for one
sampling occasion (*j*=1), within which 9 PRBs are used and 1 left
spare. Among 9 used PRBs, one is multiplexed by 4 layers, three is
multiplexed by 2 layers, and five only has 1 layer (no multiplexing). So
the *L*<sub>aveUL</sub> in this case is: (1\*4+3\*2+5\*1)/(1+3+5) = 1.67

\- According to TS 38.413 \[11\] the cause within the NG: UE context
Release Command related to double NG shall correspond to “Release due to
CN-detected mobility” when in this scenario the context release is
requested by the AMF because CN detected the UE is already served either
by another NG interface or there are two logical NG-connections for the
same UE of the same NG interface.

\- The samples with PDU SESSION RESOURCE RELEASE COMMAND with NAS Normal
cause related to the 5QI 1 QoS Flow received prior to NG: UE context
Release Command with the cause related to the double NG from AMF must be
excluded from counting because they point out the second party normally
terminated the call, which means the end user has to re-dial the call
again.

\- One use case of the measurement is to evaluate the interruption time
of the QoS of the 5QI 1 Flows due to double NG (double UE context)”.
Furthermore, the 5QI 1 QoS Flows that shall be immediately released due
to radio reasons with UE connectivity lost (when T-RLF timer was not
started) can be delayed by time interval based on this measurement to
possibly transform them to double NG scenario to reduce further the 5QI
1 QoS flow Drop Ratio.

The UPF performs QoS monitoring per the request received from SMF during
PDU Session Establishment or Modification procedure.

> NOTE: The UPF may sample the GTP packets for QoS monitoring, the
> specific sampling rate is up to implementation.

For each received GTP PDU monitoring response packet (packet i) for QoS
monitoring, the PSA UPF records the following time stamps and
information (see TS 23.501 \[4\] and TS 38.415 \[31\]):

\- T3 received in the GTP-U header of the monitoring response packet
indicating the local time that the monitoring response packet was sent
by the NG-RAN;

\- T4 that the monitoring response packet was received by the PSA UPF;

\- The UL Delay Result from UE to NG-RAN indicating the uplink delay
measurement result which is the sum of the delay incurred in NG-RAN
(including the delay at gNB-CU-UP, on F1-U and on gNB-DU) and the delay
over Uu interface, and the D1 UL PDCP delay occurred in the UE (see TS
38.415 \[31\]. The UL Delay Result is denoted by DRul in the present
document;

\- The S-NSSAI associated to the GTP PDU monitoring response packet.

The PSA UPF 1) takes the following calculation for each GTP PDU
monitoring response packet (packet i) for each S-NSSAI, and 2)
increments the corresponding bin with the delay range where the result
of 1) falls into by 1 for the subcounter per S-NSSAI.

########  Annex A (informative): Use cases for performance measurements

A.1 Monitoring of UL and DL user plane latency in NG-RAN
========================================================

Satisfying low latency expectations for 5G services, such as URLLC, is
one of the key tasks for the operator to meet service performance
expectations. As the performance in UL and DL differs, it is important
for operators to be able to monitor the UL and DL user plane latencies
separately. With performance measurements allowing the operator to
obtain or derive the UL and DL user plane latency information
separately, the operators can pinpoint the services performance problems
to specific problems in UL or DL.

The DL IP latency monitoring in NG-RAN refers to the transmission within
gNB of IP packets arriving when there is no other prior data to be
transmitted to the same UE in the gNB.

The average DL latency needs to be measured to give an general
indication of the latency performance; further more the latency
distributions (into bins with latency ranges) need to be measured, to
tell the occurrences about the packets with each certain range of
latency and better reflect the user experience.

Different network slices may have different requirements on the delay,
so the delay needs to be measured for each S-NSSAI.

To further pinpoint performance problem detected, separate counters may
be provided per mapped 5QI (which are particularly useful when the
mapped 5QI is used by few services and users and the packet size does
not vary much).

A.2 Monitoring of UL and DL packet loss in NG-RAN
=================================================

Keeping track of UL and DL packet loss in the NG-RAN is essential, since
for certain services packets that are lost along the way through the
system may have a noticeable impact on the end user. UL and DL packet
loss measurements (associated with packets measurements at the same
time) can be useful for evaluation, optimization and for performance
assurance within the integrity area (user plane connection quality).
Subcounters per QoS Level as well as per supported S-NSSAI is helpful
for operator to pinpoint the reason for high packet loss rate.

UL packet loss is a measure of packets dropped in the UE and the packets
lost on the interfaces (air interface and F1-U interface). DL packet
loss is a measure of packets lost on the interfaces (air interface and
F1-U interface). If parts of the gNB are deployed in a virtualized
environment, it is important to measure the packet loss on air interface
and F1-U interface in a separate measurements, to be able to pinpoint
the reason for high packet loss.

A.3 Monitoring of DL packet drop in NG-RAN
==========================================

Keeping track of DL packet drops in the NG-RAN is essential, since for
certain services packets that are dropped along the way through the
system may have a noticeable impact on the end user. DL packet drop
measurements (associated with total packets measurements at the same
time) can be useful for evaluation, optimization and for performance
assurance of the network. Subcounters per QoS Level as well as per
supported S-NSSAI is helpful for operator to pinpoint the reason for
high packet drop rate.

For gNBs that are deployed in a split architecture, e.g. when parts of a
gNB are deployed in a virtualized environment, the DL packet drops may
occur in two parts; the gNB CU-UP and the gNB DU. Therefore, it is
important to measure this separately.

A.4 Monitoring of UL and DL user plane delay in NG-RAN
======================================================

Satisfying low packet delay is of prime concern for some services,
particularly conversational services like speech and instant
messaging. As the performance in UL and DL differs, it is important for
operators to be able to monitor the UL and DL user plane delay
separately. With performance measurements allowing the operator to
obtain or derive the UL and DL user plane delay information separately,
the operators can pinpoint the services performance problems to specific
problems in UL or DL.

The DL delay monitoring in gNB refers to the delay of any packet within
NG-RAN, including air interface delay until the UE receives the packet.
A gNB deployed in a split architecture, the user plane delay will occur
in gNB-CU-UP, on the F1 interface, in gNB-DU and on the air interface.
Therefore, the delay measurements related to the four segments needs to
be monitored for the DL delay to pinpoint where end user impact from
packet delay occurs.

The average DL delay needs to be measured to give a general indication
of the delay performance; further more the delay distributions (into
bins with delay ranges) need to be measured, to tell the occurrences
about the packets with each certain range of delay and better reflect
the user experience.

The UL delay monitoring in gNB refers to the delay of any packet within
NG-RAN, including air interface delay until the packet leaves gNB-CU-UP.
There are 4 components associated to UL delay (UL over-the-air interface
delay, gNB-DU delay, F1-U delay, CU-UP delay). Therefore, the delay
measurements related to these four segments needs to be monitored for
the UL delay to pinpoint where end user impact from packet delay occurs.
The beamforming capabilities of the NRCellDU and of the UE can be
different. This might create a difference in the successful reception
probability of the DL data transmitted by the gNB-DU, versus the UL data
transmitted by the UE as the later might involve more retransmission
than the former one. This will increase the UL over-the-air delay
compared to the DL over-the-air delay.

For multi-operator RAN sharing scenario, different operators may have
different requirements on the packet delay. It is of great importance to
enable each operator to monitor the packet delay within its PLMN, also
it helps the operators to pinpoint the network and service performance
problems in a specific PLMN.

Different network slices may have different requirements on the delay,
so the delay needs to be measured for each S-NSSAI.

To further pinpoint a detected delay performance problem, the packet
delay measurement separation may be based on mapped 5QI (or for QCI in
case of NR option 3).

NOTE: It is an asumtion that the DL/UL delay on the F1 interface is
equal, only DL measurement is defined.

A.5 Monitoring of UE Context Release Request (gNB-DU initiated) 
===============================================================

In order to monitor the stability of the network and detect the
service/connection interruption caused by NGRAN, monitoring the UE
Context Release Request initiated by gNB-DU is an effective method.
Collecting the measurements for these events and analysing the releasing
cause conveyed in the message, operators could detect the stability of
NG-RAN, and could decide a specific means to improve the NG-RAN
performance. Moreover, measuring the UE Context Releases on the SSB beam
from where the UE CONTEXT is released is useful for analyzing the
coverage problem.

A.6 Monitoring of physical radio resource utilization
=====================================================

The physical radio resource utilization measurements could provide
operators the load information of the radio network during the
measurement time period. The physical radio resource utilization
measurements should reflect the average usage and the usage distribution
of the radio resource of the physical layer. The measurements can make
the operator to be aware of whether a cell has ever experienced high
load or not in the monitoring period, and is a key input to network
capacity planning and load balancing.

Network slicing is an important feature in 5GS, monitoring physical
radio resource utilization per S-NSSAI is helpful for opeators to be
aware of the load.

A.7 Monitoring of RRC connection number
=======================================

The number of the users in RRC connected and inactive mode need to be
monitored as it reflects the load of the radio network, the operators
can use this information for dynamic frequency resource allocation or
load balance purpose. Moreover, it is an important factor to be
evaluated in the radio network capacity enhancement decision-making.

A.8 Monitoring of UE Context Release (gNB-CU initiated)
=======================================================

In order to monitor the stability of the network and detect the
service/connection interruption caused by NG-RAN, monitoring the UE
Context Release Command initiated by gNB-CU is an effective method.
Collecting the measurements for these events and analysing the releasing
cause conveyed in the message, operators could detect the stability of
NG-RAN, and could decide a specific means to improve the NG-RAN
performance. Moreover, measuring the UE Context Releases on the SSB beam
from where the UE CONTEXT is released is useful for analyzing the
coverage problem.

A.9 Monitoring of UE Throughput in NG-RAN
=========================================

Keeping track of UL and DL UE throughput in the NG-RAN is essential, to
ensure end user satisfaction and well-functioning and well configured
cells and scheduling features.

The restricted UE throughput per mapped 5QI will show the scheduling
efficiency and QoS priority handling in the gNB and the ratio between
unrestricted and restricted volume will show the gNB ability to handle
small data transfers efficiently.

To be able to monitor the spread of throughput within the cell, and
estimate the ratio of satisfied users, the throughput distribution
measurement can be used.

When network slicing is supported by the NG-RAN, multiple s S-NSSAIs may
be supported. The UL and DL UE throughput for each S-NSSAI is then of
importance to the operator to pinpoint a specific performance problem.

For RAN sharing scenarios, the UL and DL UE throughput in each PLMN is
of importance to pinpoint performance problem in a specific PLMN.

A.10 Monitoring of Unrestricted volume in NG-RAN
================================================

Measuring the share of unrestricted user data volume in the NG-RAN is
important, to show the gNB ability to handle small data transfers
efficiently and to see how large share of the volume that is part of the
UE throughput measurement. It is not meaningful to measure throughput
for data transfers so small that they fit in one single slot but it is
still important to know how much such transfers can be handled by the
gNB.

When network slicing is supported by the NG-RAN, multiple s S-NSSAIs may
be supported. The share of unrestricted volume for each S-NSSAI is then
of importance to the operator to pinpoint a specific performance
problem.

A.11 N3 data volume related measurements
========================================

N3 related measurements are used to measure data volume on N3 interface
including incoming and outgoing of GTP data packets in total and per QoS
level without counting the mandatory part of the GTP-U header

It is useful to analyse transport bandwidth usage of N3 interface in
total and QoS level granularity. If the transport bandwidth usage is too
high, more bandwidth should be deployed, or load balance should be
considered according to core network dimension if there are multiple
UPFs connected to multiple gNodeBs. Decision on the additional bandwidth
provisioning or load balancing can be made in more fine grained level
due to the QoS level measurement.

So it is necessary to define N3 related measurements.

A.12 N6 related measurements
============================

N6 related measurements are used to measure data volume on N6 interface
including incoming and outgoing of IP data packets.

It is useful to analyse transport bandwidth usage of N6 interface. If
the transport bandwidth usage is too high, more bandwidth should be
deployed.

So it is necessary to define N6 related measurements.

A.13 Registration related measurements
======================================

A UE needs to register with the 5GS to get authorization to receive
services, to enable mobility tracking and to enable reachability. The
following registration types are defined:

\- Initial Registration to the 5GS;

\- Mobility Registration Update (upon changing to a new Tracking Area
(TA) outside the UE's Registration Area in both CM-CONNECTED and CM-IDLE
state, or when the UE needs to update its capabilities or protocol
parameters that are negotiated in Registration procedure with or without
changing to a new TA);

\- Periodic Registration Update (due to a predefined time period of
inactivity); and

\- Emergency Registration (i.e. the UE is in limited service state).

The registration may be via 3GPP access, or via untrusted or trusted
non-3GPP access.

The performance of registration for each registration type needs to be
monitored by the operator since it is relevant to whether the end user
can use the service of 5GS or a specific network slice. The performance
of registration via 3GPP access and non-3GPP access (including untrusted
and trusted non-3GPP access) needs to be monitored respectively.

A.14 PDU session establishment related measurements
===================================================

The PDU session establishment is one of essential procedures for 5G
network. The performance of PDU session establishment directly impacts
the QoS of the network and the QoE of the end users. Therefore, the
performance measurements are needed to reflect the performance of the
PDU session establishment.

The PDU sessions are created in two scerarios; Non-roaming/LBO-roaming
and HR-roaming, and are created by (V-)SMF and H-SMF respectively.

On receipt by the (V-)SMF from AMF of Nsmf\_PDUSession\_CreateSMContex
Request, the PDU session is created in non-roaming/LBO-roaming scenario
and HR-roaming scenario.

On receipt by the H-SMF from V-SMF of Nsmf\_PDUSession\_Create Request,
the PDU session is created in HR-roaming scenario.

The number and success rate of PDU session creations, the number of PDU
sessions running on the SMF are some of the basic performance
measurements to monitor the performance of the PDU session
establishment. And the performance measurements of failed PDU session
creations are helpful to solve the network issues in case the
performance is below the expectation.

A.15 Policy association related measurements
============================================

To ensure the UE properly use the services provided by 5GS, the UE needs
to be associated with a set of policies. The policies are categorized
into AM policy, SM policy and UE policy and these kinds of policies are
provisioned by PCF.

The AM policy association needs to be established in case the UE
initially registers to the network or the UE needs the AMF
re-allocation. The AM policy association needs to be updated when the
policy control request trigger is met or the AMF is relocated due to the
UE mobility and the old PCF is selected (see clause 4.2 in TS
29.507\[39\]).

The SM policy association needs to be established when the UE requests a
PDU Session Establishment. The SM policy association needs to be updated
when Policy Control Request Trigger condition is met (see clause 4.2 in
TS 29.512\[40\]).

The UE policy association needs to be established in the following
scenarios:

1\. UE initial registration with the network when a UE Policy Container
is received.

2\. The AMF relocation with PCF change in handover procedure and
registration procedure.

3\. UE registration with 5GS when the UE moves from EPS to 5GS and there
is no existing UE Policy Association between AMF and PCF for this UE.

The policy association establishment is the essential steps allowing the
UE to be served by the 5GS under the designed policies, therefore it
needs to be monitored.

A.16 Monitoring of PDU session resource setup in NG-RAN
=======================================================

The PDU Session Resource Setup procedure in NG-RAN is to assign
resources on Uu and NG-U for one or several PDU session resources and
the corresponding QoS flows, and to setup corresponding Data Radio
Bearers for a given UE.

The PDU Session Resource Setup is one of the most key procedure to
allocate resources in the NG-RAN to the UE per the QoS requirements for
the NSSAI(s). Whether or not the PDU Session Resource is successfully
setup for the NSSAI(s) has direct impact to the user experience. The
failed PDU Session Resource Setup may directly cause the service failure
for an end user. So, the performance related to the PDU Session Resource
Setup for the gNB needs to be monitored.

A.17 Monitoring of handovers
============================

Mobility is one of the most significant feature of the mobile networks,
and handover is one typical action of the mobility. The handover failure
would cause service discontinuation, thus the performance of the
handover has direct impact to the user experience.The handover procedure
includes handover preparation, handover resource allocation and handover
execution, and the performance related to handover needs to be monitored
for each phase. The resources (e.g., PDU Session Resource) need to be
prepared and allocated for a handover according to the QoS requirements
for each S-NSSAI.

The handover could occur intra-gNB and inter-gNB for 5G networks, and
for inter-gNB case the handover could happen via NG or Xn interface. The
handover could occur Intra-frequency and Inter-frequency for 5G
networks. The handover could also occur between 5GS and EPS.

It is also important to have information about the used beams in the
source and target cells in order to optimize the handover performance
taking beam ids into account.

For the handover failures, the measurements with specific causes are
required for trouble shooting.

The handover parameters setting could be specific for each NCR, and the
handover performance could vary significantly for different NCRs,
therefore the performance needs to be measured per NCR to support
handover parameters optimization when necessary.

A.18 Monitor of BLER performance 
================================

The TB Error Rate in UL/DL can directly reflect the BLER, and has an
influence on MCS selection and user throughput. It can be helpful to
estimate the performance of radio resource management like radio
resource schedulein transport layer and be helpful in trouble shooting.
Furthermore, they should be taken into account to optimize the system
performance. To obtain TB Error Rate by calculating, the number of total
and error TBs transmitted in a cell should be monitored.

A.19 Monitor of ARQ and HARQ performance
========================================

Reliable Packet Delivery is one of the important Performance factor for
a better User experience. HARQ re-transmissions at the MAC layer ensure
reliable packet delivery

In addition, RLC can be configured to operate in acknowledged mode for
those applications that need very low packet drops and can tolerate a
slightly higher delay from RLC re-transmissions.

If a MAC PDU is not delivered, HARQ takes care of re-transmitting (up to
a maximum configurable number). If all the re-transmissions fail at MAC
layer, and if RLC is configured to operate in acknowledged mode, RLC's
ARQ mechanism will take care of any residual packet errors.

It is important to:

a\) Maintain the block error rate or packet error rate within tolerable
limits.

b\) Ensure that HARQ re-transmissions take care of most packet errors,
instead of relying on RLC layer re-transmissions (which would increase
the delay).

So, it is important to monitor the performance of these schemes.

HARQ Performance if viewed at MCS (Modulation Coded Scheme) can help in
monitoring the MCS Performance also.

A.20 Monitoring of PDU session modifications
============================================

The PDU session may need to be modified by various causes (see TS 29.502
\[14\]), whether a PDU session can be successful modified may impact the
communication services supported by the PDU session. Therefore the
performance of PDU session modification procedures need to be monitored.
Besides PDU session modification requests and successes, the PDU session
modification failures with specific causes need to be monitored for
trouble shooting.

A.21 Monitoring of PDU session releases
=======================================

The PDU session release may be released by the UE, SMF or AMF. When a
PDU session is released by an unexpected reason, the user service would
be impacted. The PDU session releases initiated by the UE and SMF are
usually triggered by normal reason (e.g., UE deregistration, under
request from DN, etc.). The PDU session releases initiated by AMF may be
due to an abnormal reason (e.g., mismatch of PDU Session status between
UE and AMF). Therefore the PDU session releases initiated by AMF need to
be monitored.

A.22 Monitoring of N4 session management
========================================

UPF handles the user plane path of PDU Sessions. UPF selection is
performed by SMF, and deployments where a UPF is controlled either by a
single SMF or multiple SMFs (for different PDU Sessions) are supported.

The SMF uses N4 session management procedures to control the traffic
detection, traffic reporting, QoS enforcement and traffic routing of the
UPF.

The N4 session management procedures include N4 Session Establishment
procedure, N4 session Modification procedure and N4 session release
procedure.

If PDF fails to handle the user plane path for a PDU session, the user
service will be impacted. So the performance about N4 session management
needs to be monitored.

A.23 Use case of VR measurements for NF
=======================================

In case the NF is virtualized, the performance of an NF may be impacted
by the underlying VRs (i.e., virtual CPUs, virtual memories, virtual
storages, and connection data volumes). To enable the operator to
analyze the impact of the VRs to the performance of the NF, the
performance of the virtual compute, virtual memory and virtual disk also
needs to be monitored. The usage is the key measurement for the
performance of the VR, it can tell whether the VR is overloaded and
whether the VR is efficiently utilized. By correlating the VR related
measurements with the performance measurement of the NF, the operator
can know whether the NF performance issue is caused by the VRs or not.
When necessary, the operator may take appropriate action to solve the
performance issue of the NF, for example, to scale in/out the VNF
instance(s) that realizes the NF, or switch on/off the auto-scaling for
the VNF instance(s).

A.24 Monitoring of DRB Setup in NG-RAN
======================================

The DRB setup procedure in NG-RAN is to assign resources in gNB and on
the air interface (Uu) for one or several DRBs that will handle the QoS
flows requested to setup by the core network. The gNB may map several
QoS flows to the same DRB so there is no one-to-one mapping between the
flows and DRBs.

At DRB setup, the gNB will handle all QoS flows mapped to one DRB the
same (mapped 5QI). A QoS flow that is at a later stage mapped to an
already setup existing DRB will not increment the DRB setup counters.

The DRB setup is one of the most key procedures to allocate resources in
the NG-RAN to the UE per the QoS requirements. Whether or not the DRB is
successfully setup has direct impact to the user experience. A failed
DRB setup may directly cause service failure or degradation for an end
user. So, the performance related to the DRB setup for the gNB needs to
be monitored per supported mapped 5QI and per S-NSSAI.

A.25 Monitoring of PDCP data volume measurements
================================================

In 5GS, Cell PDCP data volume is a useful measurement which represents
the real data traffic for each cell. The monitor of the Cell PDCP data
volume could provide operators the traffic information and is useful for
operators to do cell load evaluation, load balancing and cell capacity
planning.

In addition, in scenarios of dual connectivity, for split bearers, PDCP
data is transferred between the MN and the SN via the MN-SN user plane
interface. To monitor the real PDCP data volume transmitted in MN and SN
in MR-DC scenarios, the data volume transferred between MN and SN should
be counted.

A.26 Monitoring of RF performance
=================================

RF Performance includes performance of Power Resource Utilization, RF
signal, TA, interference and etc. Monitoring of the performance
measurements can help to reflect the cell loading information and
abnormal conditions.

Monitoring of the quality of RF signal in the cell is useful for the
purpose of network planning and overall service quality assessment.
Measurements of Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) reported by UEs is a
useful metric reflecting RF signal quality and service quality.

A.27 Monitoring of RF measurements
==================================

MCS represents the modulation and coding schemes scheduled for the
physical resources by NG-RAN. The measurements of MCS distribution is a
useful metric reflecting the efficiency for PDSCH and PUSCH RBs. It is
helpful for operator to optimize the scheduling of physical resources to
improve the network efficiency and overall service quality.

The MCS scheduling strategies of MU-MIMO and SU-MIMO are different due
to factors such as user pairing and interference. So it is necessary to
distinguish statistics and measurements of MCS distribution for MU-MIMO
and SU-MIMO.

A.28 Monitor of QoS flow release
================================

QoS flow is the key and limited resource for 5G RAN (including NG-RAN
and non-3GPP access) to deliver services. The release of the QoS flow
needs to be monitored as:

\- an abnormal release of the QoS flow will cause the call(/session)
drop, which directly impacts the QoS delivered by the networks, and the
satisfaction degree of the end user;

\- a successfully released QoS flow can be used to setup other requested
calls(/sessions). The QoS flow failed to be released will still occupy
the limited resource and hence it can not be used to admit other
requested calls(/sessions).

From a retainability measurement aspect, QoS flows do not need to be
released because they are inactive, they can be kept to give fast access
when new data arrives.

To define (from a QoS flow release measurement point of view) if a QoS
flow is considered active or not, the QoS flow can be divided into two
groups:

For QoS flows with bursty flow, a UE is said to be "in session" if there
is user data in the PDCP queue in any of the directions or if any QoS
flow data on a Data Radio Bearer (UL or DL) has been transferred during
the last 100 ms.  
For QoS flows with continuous flow, the QoS flow (and the UE) is seen as
being "in session" in the context of this measurement as long as the UE
is in RRC connected state, and the session time is increased from the
first data transmission on the QoS flow until 100 ms after the last data
transmission on the QoS flow.

A particular QoS flow is defined to be of type continuous flow if the
5QI is any of {1, 2, 65, 66}.

The specific reason causing the abnormal and failed release of the QoS
flow is required in order to find out the problem and ascertain the
solutions. And due to different priority and tolerance for different
service type with different QoS level in the networks, the monitor needs
to be opened on each service type with QoS level.

The QoS flow can be released by PDU Session Resource Release procedure,
UE Context Release procedure, Reset procedure either initiated by 5G RAN
(including NG-RAN and non-3GPP access) or AMF and NG Path Switch
procedure (see TS 38.413 \[11\]).

So performance measurements related to QoS flow Release (see TS 38.413
\[11\]) and UE Context Release (see TS 38.413 \[11\]) procedure for each
service type with QoS level are necessary to support the monitor of QoS
flow release.

The abnormal release of the QoS flow has potential scenario where,
regardless of receiving the UE Context Release Command with the cause
related to abnormal release, the end user does not perceive it as
abnormal. This scenario is explicitly related to 5QI 1 calls, for other
services it is not possible to determine the reason behind the cause
code. It is typical to encounter such scenario, a so called "double UE
Context", when Radio Link Failure occurs during an ongoing 5QI 1 call
and RRC Connection Re-establishment attempt fails on target or other
cell. If then the UE does a new RRC Connection the 5QI 1 QoS flow is
set-up during Initial Context Setup in the target or other cell.
However, when AMF receives that service request with the Initial UE
message through the target or other cell, it realizes that it already
has the same UE Context but from the source cell (it has not been
released yet). In such case, AMF sends UE Context Release Command to the
source cell. As the 5QI 1 QoS flow has been successfully setup in the
target or other cell, the 5QI 1 QoS flow release in the source cell may
not be perceived as a drop (abnormal release) by the end user, as the
service has been sustained with some interruption time, and can't be
considered as a drop in the 5QI 1 QoS flow Drop Ratio. This interruption
time may be monitored in order to evaluate how it can impact the QoS of
the 5QI 1 Flows due to double NG (double UE context)". Moreover, the 5QI
1 QoS Flows that can be immediately released due to radio reasons with
UE connectivity lost (when T-RLF timer was not started) may be delayed
by time interval based on this average interruption time to possibly
transform them to double NG scenario to keep the calls active and reduce
further the 5QI 1 QoS flow Drop Ratio.

From QoS perspective it is important to focus also on call duration as
in some cases wrong quality perceived by the end user is not fully
reflected by drop ratio nor retainability KPI. Typical case is when due
to poor radio conditions the end user redials (the call was terminated
normally) to the same party to secure the quality. But in this case the
drop ratio KPI will not show any degradation. Secondly, although the
call is dropped the end user may or may not redial depending on dropped
call duration compared to the case when the call would be normally
released. It is therefore highly recommended to monitor average and
distribution of duration of normally and abnormally released calls.

A.29 Monitor of call (/session) setup performance
=================================================

Call(/session) setup is one of most important step to start delivering
services by the networks to users.

The success or failure of a call(/session) setup directly impacts the
quality level for delivering the service by the networks, and also the
feeling of the end user. So the success or failure of call(/session)
setup needs be monitored, this can be achieved by the calculation of
call setup success rate which gives a direct view to evaluate the call
setup performance, and the analysis of the specific reason causing the
failure to find out the problem and ascertain the solutions.

In addition, the time duration of the call(/session) setup need to be
monitored as it impacts the end user experience, and by comparison with
operator's benchmark requirements, the optimization may be required
according the performance.

To support the monitor of success or failure of the call(/session)
setup, the performance measurements related toPDU Session Resource
Setup/modify (See TS 38.413\[11\]) in NG-RAN or via trusted/untrusted
non-3GPP access and Initial Context Setup (See TS 38.413\[11\])
procedures for each QoS level and each S-NSSAI are needed.

A.30 Void
=========

A.31 Monitoring of QoS flows for SMF
====================================

To support a service for a UE, the QoS flow supporting the specific QoS
needs to be added or modified. If the QoS flow fails to be added or
modified, the user service cannot be conducted or the QoS cannot be met.
So the QoS flow addition and modification need to be monitored.

Furthermore, in order to know the UE traffic pattern at SMF, it is
necessary to monitor the peak and mean number of ongoing QoS flows for
each granularity period.

A.32 Monitoring of service requests
===================================

The Service Request procedure is initiated via 3GPP access:

by the UE in CM‑IDLE state in order to send uplink signalling messages,
user data, or as a response to a network paging request; or

by the network when the network needs to signal (e.g. N1 signalling to
UE, Mobile-terminated SMS, User Plane connection activation for PDU
Session(s) to deliver mobile terminating user data) with a UE.

The Service Request procedure via non-3GPP Access (including untrusted
and trusted non-3GPP access) is used by a UE:

\- in CM-IDLE state over non-3GPP access to request the re-establishment
of the NAS signalling connection and the re-establishment of the user
plane for all or some of the PDU Sessions which are associated to
non-3GPP access; and

\- in CM-CONNECTED state over non-3GPP access to request the
re-establishment of the user plane for one or more PDU Sessions which
are associated to non-3GPP access.

The Service Request procedures via 3GPP access and via untrusted/trusted
non-3GPP Access need to be monitored respectively in order to know the
performance of the 5G network in terms of providing services to the UEs.

A.33 Monitoring of DL PDCP UE buffered throughput
=================================================

To monitor DL PDCP buffered throughput per UE and bearer is essential,
to ensure end user satisfaction and well functioning and well configured
cells. If an end user often experiences low quality during use of a
service, the end-user might change wireless subscription provider, i.e.
loss of income for the network operator.

A.34 Monitoring of RRC connection setup in NG-RAN
=================================================

RRC connection setup is one of most important step to start delivering
services by the networks to users, (see TS 38.331 \[20\]).

Whether or not the RRC connection is successfully setup has direct
impact to the user experience. A failed RRC connection setup may cause
service failure or failure in updating tracking area information for an
end user. So, the performance related to the RRC connection setup for
the gNB needs to be monitored. This can be achieved by the calculation
of RRC connection setup success (or failure) rate (number of successful
(or failed) / number of attempt) which gives a direct view to evaluate
the RRC connection setup performance, and the analysis of the specific
reason causing the failure to find out the problem and ascertain the
solutions.

Since the intended service is not yet know when establishing the RRC
connection, it is not possible to do separation between QoS classes or
S-NSSAIs.

A.35 Monitoring of UE associated NG signalling connection setup in NG-RAN
=========================================================================

The NG signalling connection setup procedure in NG-RAN is to establish
signalling connection between gNB and AMF for a given UE.

Whether or not the NG signalling connection is successfully setup has
direct impact on the user experience. A failed NG signalling connection
setup may directly cause service failure or failure in updating tracking
area information for an end user. So, the performance related to the NG
signalling connection setup for the gNB needs to be monitored. This can
be achieved by the calculation of success rate for UE associated NG
signalling connection (number of successful / number of attempted) which
gives a direct view to evaluate the setup performance.

Since the intended service is not yet know when establishing the UE
associated NG signalling connection, it is not possible to do separation
between QoS classes or S-NSSAI.

A.36 Monitoring of PDCP data volume per interface
=================================================

In 5GS, PDCP data volume is a useful measurement which represents the
real data traffic towards each GNBDUFunction (F1-U interface), each
external gNB-CU-UP (Xn-U interface) and each external eNB (X2-U
interface). The monitoring of the PDCP data volume could provide
operators with traffic information and is a useful measure in
performance assurance within integrity area (user plane connection
quality) and in energy efficiency evaluation.

A.37 Monitoring of RRC connection re-establishment
==================================================

The failed RRC connection re-establishment will cause the call
(/session) drop, which directly impacts the QoS delivered by the
networks.

A.38 Monitoring of RRC connection resuming
==========================================

RRC connection resuming is one of important step to start delivering
services by the networks to users or for RNA update.

The success or failure of a RRC connection resuming directly impacts the
quality level for delivering the service by the networks, and also the
feeling of the end user. So the success or failure of RRC connection
resuming needs be monitored, this can be achieved by the calculation of
RRC connection resuming success rate which gives a direct view to
evaluate the resume performance, and the analysis of the specific reason
causing the failure to find out the problem and ascertain the solutions.

A.39 Monitoring of inter-AMF handovers
======================================

The handover could occur from a source NG-RAN to the target NG-RAN that
are served by different AMFs. During the handover, the PDU sessions and
QoS flows need to be setup in the target side. The failure of the PDU
session setup or QoS flow setup during the inter-AMF handover has direct
impact to the user's experience. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor
the performance related to PDU session setup or QoS flow setup for the
Inter-AMF handover.

A.40 Monitoring of incoming/outgoing GTP packet loss on N3
==========================================================

Keeping track of GTP data packet loss over N3 is essential, since for
certain services packets that are lost along the way through the system
may have a noticeable impact on the end user. Incoming/outgoing GTP data
packet loss measurements can be useful for evaluation, optimization, and
performance assurance between gNB and UPF in the core. It is also
important for the performance measurement of end-to-end point of view
from UE to UPF. Performance degradation can happen any point although
the focus is centered more at UE and RAN. When the monitoring
incoming/outgoing GTP packet loss on N3 requires specific measurements
per GTP tunnel, the monitoring of incoming/outgoing GTP packet loss on
N3 can use subcounters per TEID to provide the measurements within a GTP
tunnel.

A.41 Monitoring of round-trip GTP packet delay on N3
====================================================

Keeping track of GTP data packet delay over N3 is essential, since for
certain services packet delay along the way through the system may have
a noticeable impact on the end user. Incoming/outgoing GTP data packet
delay measurements can be useful for evaluation, optimization, and
performance assurance between gNB and UPF in the core. It is also
important for the performance measurement of end-to-end point of view
from UE to UPF. Performance degradation can happen any point although
the focus is centered more at UE and RAN.

A.42 Monitoring of PDU session resource management for untrusted non-3GPP access
================================================================================

The PDU Session Resource management procedure for Untrusted non-3GPP
Access is to manage resources in Untrusted non-3GPP Access for the PDU
sessions.

The PDU Session Resource needs to be setup or modified via the Untrusted
non-3GPP Access for the UE per the QoS requirements for the NSSAI(s).

The PDU Session Resource setup and modification via the Untrusted
non-3GPP Access have direct impact to the user experience. So, the
performance related to the PDU Session Resource setup and modification
via the Untrusted non-3GPP Access needs to be monitored.

A.43 Monitor of DRB release
===========================

DRB is the key and limited resource for NG-RAN to deliver services. Once
a QoS flow reaches a gNB it will trigger setup of a new DRB or it will
be mapped to an existing DRB. The decision on how to map QoS flows into
new or existing DRBs is taken at the CU-CP. CU-CP also defines one set
of QoS parameters (one 5QI) for the DRB. If a QoS flow is mapped to an
existing DRB, the packets belonging to that QoS flow are not treated
with the 5QI of the QoS flow, but they are treated with the mapped 5QI
of the DRB.

The release of the DRB needs to be monitored as:

\- an abnormal release of the DRB will cause the call(/session) drop,
which directly impacts the QoS and slice delivered by the network, and
the satisfaction degree of the end user;

\- a successfully released DRB can be used to setup other requested
calls(/sessions). The DRB failed to be released will still occupy the
limited resource and hence it can not be used to admit other requested
calls(/sessions).

From a retainability measurement aspect, DRBs do not need to be released
because they are inactive, they can be kept to give fast access when new
data arrives.

To define (from a DRB release measurement point of view) if a DRB is
considered active or not, the DRB can be divided into two groups:

\- For DRBs with bursty flow, a DRB is said to be active if there is
user data in the PDCP queue in any of the directions or if any data (UL
or DL) has been transferred during the last 100 ms.

\- For DRBs with continuous flow, the DRB is seen as being active in the
context of this measurement as long as the UE is in RRC connected state,
and the session time is increased from the first data transmission on
the DRB until 100 ms after the last data transmission on the DRB.

A particular DRB is defined to be of type continuous flow if the mapped
5QI is any of {1, 2, 65, 66}.

Due to different priority and tolerance for different service type with
different QoS level in the DRB, the measurement needs to be performed
per mapped 5QI, to be able to judge the result.  

Similarly, the abnormal and failed DRB releases will affect different
Service Level Agreements in the networks. Therefore, each S-NSSAI needs
to be monitored.

The DRB can be released by PDU Session Resource Release procedure, UE
Context Release procedure, Reset procedure either initiated by NG-RAN or
AMF and NG Path Switch procedure (see TS 38.413 \[11\]).

Therefore, performance measurements related to DRB Release (see TS
38.413 \[11\]) and UE Context Release (see TS 38.413 \[11\]) procedure
for each QoS level (mapped 5QI) and each S-NSSAI are necessary to
support the monitor of DRB release.

A.44 Monitoring of application triggering
=========================================

When the AF needs to trigger the UE for some actions, the AF requests
the NEF to send an application trigger to the UE.

The application in the UE may perform actions as indicated by the
Trigger payload when the Triggered payload is received at the UE. For
example initiation of immediate or later communication with the
application server based on the information contained in the Trigger
payload, which includes the PDU Session Establishment procedure if the
related PDU Session is not already established.

Therefore, to ensure the application run normally, the network needs to
successfully deliver the application trigger to the UE.

A.45 Monitoring of SMS over NAS
===============================

The SMS can be transferred over NAS in 5G networks. To enable SMS over
NAS transporting, the UE includes an "SMS supported" indication in
Registration Request indicating the UE's capability for SMS over NAS
transport, and in the Registration Accept the networks indicates to the
UE whether the network allows the SMS message delivery over NAS. If the
SMS over NAS is allowed by the network, the SMS messages can be
originated or terminated by the UE, via 3GPP or non-3GPP access.

The performance of SMS over NAS, as a service provided to the end users,
has direct impact to user experience and user satisfaction, and thus
needs to be monitored. For this purpose, the measurements for the
following aspects are needed:

\- registration procedure for SMS over NAS to reflect whether the UEs
are allowed or disallowed to send or receive SMS messages over NAS;

\- the number of SMS messages requested to be sent or received over NAS
and the number of SMS messages successfully delivered over NAS, which
can directly reflect whether the services can be successfully delivered
to the users.

A.46 Monitoring of round-trip GTP packet delay on N9
====================================================

When I-UPF exists, the delay over N9 interface for DL/UL data packets is
essential as part of the e2e packet delay, since for certain services
packet delay along the way through the system may have a noticeable
impact on the end user. RTT GTP data packet delay measurements for DL/UL
data packets can be useful for evaluation, optimization, and performance
assurance for the N9 interface between PSA UPF and I-UPF. It is also
important for the performance measurement of end-to-end point of view
from UE to PSA UPF. Performance degradation can happen any point, so the
RTT N9 delay needs to be measured at PSA UPF and I-UPF respectively. The
GTP packets are prioritized for transmitting using DSCPs, so it is
necessary to measure the round-trip GTP packet delay per DSCP.

A.47 Monitoring of GTP packets delay in UPF
===========================================

The GTP packets may be delayed on the interfaces and in the NFs. For
some services (such as URLLC sevices), the end to end packet delay in
the network has clear impact to users' experience. The GTP packets delay
in the UPF, as one segment of the end to end delay in the network, needs
to be measured in order to indicate where the performance degradation
happens. The GTP packets are prioritized for transmitting for different
5QIs and S-NSSAIs, so the measurements per 5QI and S-NSSAI are needed.

A.48 Monitoring of round-trip delay between PSA UPF and UE
==========================================================

The end to end delay in 5G networks between UE and PSA UPF has direct
impact to users' experience for some types of services (e.g., URLLC). In
case the PSA UPF and NG-RAN are not time synchronised, the round-trip
delay between PSA UPF and UE can be measured at PSA UPF.

The measurements on the round-trip delay between PSA UPF and NE can be
used to evaluate the user plane delay performance in 5G networks and
users' experience.

A.49 Monitoring of Power, Energy and Environmental (PEE) parameters
===================================================================

Power, Energy and Environmental (PEE) parameters, combined with data
volume measurements, are valuable information for operators to measure
the energy efficiency of their 5G network. Hence it is necessary to
define PEE parameters related to 5G network such as power, energy,
temperature, voltage, current and humidity.

A.50 Monitoring of UE configuration update
==========================================

To ensure the UE properly use the services provided by 5GS, the UE needs
to update access and mobility management related parameters decided and
provided by the AMF.

The UE configuration update is the essential steps allowing the UE to be
served by the 5GS under the changed configuration, therefore it needs to
be monitored.

A.51 Monitoring of subscriber's number for UDM
==============================================

The number of subscribers including registered and unregistered
subscribers for UDM need to be monitored as it reflects the service load
of the UDM, the operators can use this information for resource
allocation or load balance purpose.

A.52 Monitoring of QoS flow modification
========================================

The QoS flow may need to be modified to fulfil the updated QoS
requirements for the UE. The QoS modification success or failure has
direct impact to the users about the QoS that the network can provide.
The performance measurements related to QoS flow modification are needed
to evaluate the performance that whether or not the UE's updated QoS
requirements are fulfilled by the network, and to support finding the
causes of the failures for troubleshooting.

The QoS flows, within the PDU session, may be established in NG-RAN or
untrusted/trusted non-3GPP access, so separate performance measurements
are needed to monitor the QoS flow modifications respectively in NG-RAN
and untrusted or trusted non-3GPP access.

A.53 Monitoring of handovers between 5GS and EPS
================================================

The handover could occur between 5GS and EPS with or without N26
interface. The success or failure of the handover between 5GS and EPS
directly impacts the users' experience, especially for the service of
voice over IMS. When the handover occurs via the N26 interface, the
handover may succeed or fail on the N26 interface. The performance of
handover between 5GS and EPS needs to be monitored, and for failure
cases the measurements with specific causes are needed for trouble
shooting.

A.54 Monitoring of NF service registration and update
=====================================================

The NRF maintains the information of available NF instances and their
supported services, and each NF instance informs the NRF of the list of
NF services that it supports.

The NF instance may make this information available to NRF when the NF
instance becomes operative for the first time (registration) or upon
individual NF service instance activation/de-activation within the NF
instance (update operation) e.g. triggered after a scaling operation.
The NF instance while registering the list of NF services it supports,
for each NF service, may provide a notification endpoint information for
each type of notification service that the NF service is prepared to
consume, to the NRF during the NF instance registration. The NF instance
could also update or delete the NF service related parameters (e.g. to
delete the notification endpoint information). Registration with the NRF
includes capacity and configuration information of the NF instances and
at time of instantiation.

The failed NF service registration or update would result in that 1) the
NF service cannot be discovered or consumed by the consumer, and 2) the
NF service may not be able to receive the notifications for the other NF
services it needs to consume, such failures would impact many users who
need to be supported by the NF services. Therefore, the performance of
the NF service registration or update need to be monitored, especially
for the failure cases which need to trigger trouble shooting.

A.55 Monitoring of NF service discovery
=======================================

An NF service is one type of capability exposed by an NF (NF Service
Producer) to other authorized NF (NF Service Consumer) through a
service-based interface. A Network Function could expose one or more NF
services.

The NF discovery and NF service discovery enable Core Network entities
(NFs or Service Communication Proxy (SCP)) to discover a set of NF
instance(s) and NF service instance(s) for a specific NF service or an
NF type. Unless the expected NF and NF service information is locally
configured on the requester NF, e.g. when the expected NF service or NF
is in the same PLMN as the requester NF, the NF and NF service discovery
is implemented via the Network Repository Function (NRF).

If the NF service instance(s) cannot be discovered by the NF consumer,
the network feature may not be fully supported thus the uses may suffer
from service failures. Therefore, the performance of the NF service
discovery needs to be monitored.

A.56 Monitoring of PFD management
=================================

The Packet Flow Description (PFD) describes the packet flow for the
UL/DL application traffic by a tuple of protocol, server-side IP and
port number.

Management of Packet Flow Descriptions (PFDs) refers to the capability
to create, update or delete PFDs in the NEF (PFDF) for the applications
under the request of AF, and the distribution from the NEF (PFDF) to the
SMF and finally to the UPF.

The 5G network needs to have the up-to-date PFDs in order to deliver the
user data to the destination for the applications, and the applications
cannot be fulfilled without PFDs or with wrong or obsolete PFDs.
Therefore, the performance of PFD management, including PFD creation,
update, deletion, fetch and subscription, needs to be monitored.

A.57 Monitoring of incoming GTP packet out-of-order on N3 interface
===================================================================

If the sequence is out-of-order during the link transmission between gNB
and UPF, especially for the TCP-type service, fast retransmission and
even the exponential back-off process of the TCP occur, it will have a
great impact on the terminal service rate. Adding the out-of-order
packet measurement metrics on the N3 interface is helpful to better
observe and evaluate the transmission quality of the data link between
the gNB and the UPF. It is of significance to the high-rate and
high-reliability services.

A.58 Monitoring of PCI to detect PCI collision or confusion
===========================================================

Each NR cell is assigned a PCI that enables UE to uniquely identify the
cell. PCI values need to be reused, as there are only 1008 PCI values.
Typically, operators use network planning tool to assign PCIs to cells
when the network is deployed to insure all neighbouring cells have
different PCIs. However, due to the addition of new cells or changes of
neighbour relations from ANR functions, issues can arise, such as PCI
collision, PCI confusion.

The measurement of PCI values for candidate cells can be used by C-SON
to detect potential PCI issues. The example in Fig A.x.-1 show the PCI
values assigned to neighboring cells, where

\- Cell \#6: PCI = 7

\- Cell \#10: PCI = 9

\- Cell \#7: PCI = 1

\- Cell \#8: PCI = 7

C-SON PCI configuration function can collect and anaylze the
measurements to detecet the PCI issue between cell \#6 and cell \#8.

Figure A.58-1: PCI configuration example

A.59 Monitoring of RACH usage
=============================

The RACH plays a vital role in the following procedures:

> \- Initial access from RRC\_IDLE;
>
> \- Initial access after radio link failure;
>
> \- Handover requiring random access procedure;
>
> \- DL data arrival during RRC\_CONNECTED requiring random access
> procedure;
>
> \- UL data arrival during RRC\_CONNECTED requiring random access
> procedure;

Furthermore, the random access procedure takes two distinct forms:

> \- Contention based using a randomly selected preamble (applicable to
> all five events);
>
> \- Non-contention based using a dedicated preamble (applicable to only
> handover and DL data arrival).

In the use-case of RACH configuration optimization, received Random
Access Preambles and a contention indicator are signalled across an OAM
interface.

Monitoring of the preamble usage in a cell allows the operator to
determine if the resources allocated to the RACH by the gNodeB are
appropriate for the number of random access attempts. If the resources
are underutilised, then the operator may reconfigure the gNodeB (via CM)
to allocate less resource to RACH thereby freeing up resource for other
uplink transmissions. Alternatively, if the resources are heavily
utilised then this is indicative of RACH congestion leading to increased
latency for the procedures listed above. To this effect, measurements
directly reflecting RACH congestion experienced by the gNodeB and by the
UEs are useful.

The gNodeB can partition the RACH resource between dedicated preambles,
randomly selected preambles in group A and randomly selected preambles
in group B. This partitioning can be evaluated when usage measurements
are made on each set separately. In a cell configured with multiple
SSBs, it is important to get the measurements per SSB.

A.**60** Monitoring of the number of active UEs in NG-RAN
=========================================================

The number of the active UEs per direction in each cell is a valuable
measurement for operators to know how many DRBs are running with
buffered data per cell and QoS or S-NSSAI basis. For multi-operator RAN
sharing scenario, PLMN basis is needed, too. This kind of information
can help operators to tune the admission control parameters for the cell
and to estimate load in neighbour cells, to ensure that the UEs admitted
achieve the target QoS and that capacity is not over-estimated when
distributing load between cells and gNBs.

A.61 Monitoring of one way delay between PSA UPF and NG-RAN
===========================================================

The DL and UL one way delay has direct impact to users' experience for
some types of services (e.g., URLLC). The one way delay between PSA UPF
and NG-RAN is part of the end to end one-way delay and is not expected
very long comparing to the delay in between NG-RAN and UE.

In case the PSA UPF and NG-RAN are time synchronised, the UL or DL one
way delay can be measured by PSA UPF and the DL one way delay can be
measured by NG-RAN.

The measurements on the one way DL and UL delay between PSA UPF and
NG-RAN can be used to evaluate and optimize the DL and UL user plane
delay performance between 5GC and NG-RAN.

A.62 Monitoring of round-trip delay between PSA UPF and NG-RAN
==============================================================

The end to end delay in 5G networks between UE and PSA UPF has direct
impact to users' experience for some types of services (e.g., URLLC).
The delay between PSA UPF and NG-RAN is part of the end to end one-way
delay and is not expected very long comparing to the delay in between
NG-RAN and UE.

In case the PSA UPF and NG-RAN are not time synchronised, the round-trip
delay can be measured at PSA UPF.

The measurements on the round-trip delay between PSA UPF and NG-RAN can
be used to evaluate and optimize the DL and UL user plane delay
performance between 5GC and NG-RAN.

A.63 Monitoring of beam switches
================================

Beam is an important feature in 5G networks. In case the intra-beam
switch function is enabled (see TS 38.331 \[20\]), due to the complexity
of the radio environment, especially when UE moves quickly and
frequently, it is possible to have problems such as pointing deviation,
which can lead to switch failure. The success rate of beam switch can
help to reflect whether there is a problem in beam related parameter
configuration. Furthermore, low beam switch success rate will impact
user experience. Therefore, it is essential in network operations to
monitor the success rate of beam switch and to define the related
measurements.

A.64 Monitoring of RF performance
=================================

Monitoring of the quality of RF signal in the cell is useful for the
purpose of network planning and network optimization.

In case the L1-RSRP report function is enabled, measurements of RSRP per
beam reported by UEs is a useful metric reflecting RF signal strength.
In 5G NR, gNB cells transmit many narrow beams targeting UEs in the cell
that result in better link budget and lower interference. However, some
areas between beams of neighbouring NR cells , or between the NR cell
and the neighbor E-UTRA cell may experience poor coverage or coverage
holes. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the beam coverage by
coordinating the beam management function across multiple neighboring NR
cells.

The Absolute Timing Advance reflects the distance of the UE from the
cell antenna. The distribution of Absolute Timing Advance reflects UE
distribution in the NR cell, thus it is helpful for analyzing the
coverage and the capacity.

The Average Value of Timing Advance per SS-RSRP and AOA ranges reflects
the UE distribution in NR cell with different coverage qualities. It is
helpful for analyzing the cell coverage and the capacity more clearly.
Thus, it can help the network planning and optimization.

A.65 Monitoring of one way delay between PSA UPF and UE
=======================================================

The end to end DL/UL delay in 5G networks between UE and PSA UPF has
direct impact to users' experience for some types of services (e.g.,
URLLC). In case the PSA UPF and NG-RAN are time synchronised, the DL/UL
delay between PSA UPF and UE can be measured at PSA UPF.

For UL specifically, the UL packet delay in NG-RAN may be measured by
the gNB with or without D1 UL PDCP delay occurred in the UE included
(see TS 38.415 \[31\]), therefore separate measurements are needed to
monitor the integrated UL packet delay between PSA UPF and UE for the
cases of including and exluding D1 respectively.

The measurements on the DL/UL delay between PSA UPF and NE can be used
to evaluate the user plane delay performance in 5G networks and users'
experience.

A.66 Monitoring of MRO performance
==================================

5G NR cells may experience issues, such as too early or too late
handover, handover to wrong cell, ping-pong handover, that not only
impact user experience, but also waste network resources, if handover
parameters are not set properly. MRO is intended to automatically detect
the handover issues, and determine actions to configure the handover
parameters in cells in order to improve the handover performance.

It is also important to have information about the used beams in the
source in order to optimize the handover performance taking beam IDs
into account.

The MRO related measurements are used to support the mobility
roburstness optimization SON function.

A.67 Monitoring of distribution of integrated delay in NG-RAN
=============================================================

The integrated DL/UL packet delay in NG-RAN, i.e., the delay between
NG-RAN and UE (including the delay at gNB-CU-UP, on F1-U and on gNB-DU
for split scenario and the delay over Uu interface) is one significant
part of the e2e delay that has direct impact to users' experience for
some types of services (e.g., URLLC).

Besides the average integrated delay in NG-RAN which can reflect whether
or not the users experience can be met on average, it is very useful for
operator to know how many (percents of) data packets are with
satfistfied delay perfomance, and how many are not with satisfied
performance and how far they are from the satisfied performance.
Therefore, the distribution of integrated delay in NG-RAN needs to be
monitored.

For UL specifically, the integrated packet delay in NG-RAN may be
measured by the gNB with or without D1 UL PDCP delay occurred in the UE
included (see TS 38.415 \[31\]), therefore separate measurements are
needed to monitor the integrated UL packet delay in NG-RAN for the cases
of including and exluding D1 respectively.

As each S-NSSAI or 5QI has different requirements on the delay, so the
distribution of integrated delay in NG-RAN needs to be monitored per
S-NSSAI and per 5QI.

For multi-operator RAN sharing scenario, different operators may have
different S-NSSAI or 5QI requirements on the packet delay, so the
distribution of integrated delay in NG-RAN per S-NSSAI and per 5QI for
each PLMN needs to be monitored, too.

A.68 Monitoring of GTP data packets and volume on N9 interface
==============================================================

In 5GC, the user plane data traffic is transmitted on N9 interface
between PSA UPF and I-UPF. The data volume of GTP data packets on N9
interface is helpful for operators to understand the traffic
distribution of the 5GC, and evaluate and optimize the bandwidth of the
N9 interface. The number of GTP packets on the N9 interface is relevant
to the packets processing that may result in larger or smaller packet
delay on the interface.

Therefore, the data volume and number of GTP data packets on the N9
interface need to be monitored.

To support the resource allocation and optimization on N9 interface for
the network slicing, the data volume and GTP data packets need to be
monitored for each S-NSSAI.

A.69 Use case of UE power headroom
==================================

UE power headroom measurement is important for analyzing UE power
distribution, to learn whether the uplink signal strength can be
increased or not. So it is very useful to do trouble shooting of
coverage hole and coverage balance for uplink. It is also used to
evaluate the power control performance and increase UE power headroom as
possible with QoS is guaranteed for the purpose of energy saving. These
questions are determined by the ratio of the number of larger or less
than threshold to the total number of it and the threshold is
configurable.

A.70 Monitor of paging performance
==================================

In NR, Paging is under the control of the 5GC or NG-RAN (aka RAN
initiated paging and CN initiated paging). When the 5GC wants to page
(CN initiated paging) a UE, it has to page it in all cells that belong
to the TA(s) to which the UE is registered.

The paging load per cell and gNB is an important measure for the
operator as it allows the operator to properly dimension the resources
for paging in the NR Cell and gNB.

At an NR Cell and gNB it makes sense to measure the number of discarded
paging messages if this is due to some problem in the gNB, such as
paging occasion overflow. In that scenario the periodicity of paging
occasions can be reconfigured in order to ensure that all paging
messages are transmitted by the gNB in the first available paging
occasion, thereby avoiding paging delays and extended call setup delay.

Operators need to know when such an event occurs, in order to identify
if the problem is at the NR cell or gNB level or not.

In addition to discarded paging records measurement, it is important to
know total paging records received so that discarded paging records
ratio can be derived.

Total number of paging records received is important in the sense that,
it may be fine if the discarded paging records are high if discarded
paging records ratio is small. On the other hand, it may be problematic
if discarded paging records are low, if discarded paging records ratio
turn out to be high.

In RRC\_INACTIVE state, RAN paging is based on RNA which is introduced
in order to resume a suspended RRC connection fastly. In this scenario,
the gNB who triggered the RAN Paging can know if the paging is success
or not by the response from UE or other gNB. Measurements for NG-RAN
initiated paging sent by gNB-CU can avoid duplicate counts of RAN Paging
and improve accuracy of RAN paging success rate statistics. The total
paging number and successful paging number of NG-RAN initiated paging
sent by the gNB-CU can derive RAN paging success rate, which can be used
to optimize the RNA range configuration. It is helpful and important for
operators.

A.71 UE and traffic per SSB beam related measurements
=====================================================

UE and traffic per SSB beam related measurements is helpful for
analyzing users and services under different SSB beam coverage, and for
network optimization and adjustment of SSB beam coverage or balancing of
users and traffic under different SSB BEAM beams. Through the
statistics, operator can learn about user distribution and service
distribution which is the important information for network planning.

A.72 Monitoring of network slice selection
==========================================

The network slice selection service enables the network to select the
network slice to serve the UE, and enables the NSSF to provide the AMF
the Allowed NSSAI and the Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN.

The network slice selection service may be consumed during Registration
procedure, during inter-PLMN mobility procedure, PDU session
establishment and UE configuration update, etc.

The network slice selection is the primary step enabling the 5G networks
to support network slicing, therefore the performance of network slice
selection needs to be monitored.

A.73 Use case of EPS fallback monitor
=====================================

Under the constraints of UE and network coverage, EPS fallback is an
important means to guarantee voice continuity. Restricted by the UE
capability and network configuration, the EPS fallback supports the
modes of handover and redirection.The measurement related to EPS
fallback is helpful for evaluating voice continuity and for the
operator's network planning and optimization.

A.74 Use case of EPS fallback handover time monitor
===================================================

The measurement statistics of EPS fallback handover time include the
total time consumed by the whole handover time or the time in the
execution phase. The EPS fallback handover time directly affects user
perception, and the time in the execution phase helps to optimize the
performance of different systems.

A.75 Use case of MU-MIMO measurements
=====================================

The application of MU-MIMO greatly improves the network capacity.
Whether MU-MIMO getting the most out of itself will impact the
improvement of network capacity and performance. MU-MIMO related
statistics can reflect the disparity between the actual effect of
MU-MIMO and the maximum layers supported by the network, and help to fix
and improve the MU-MIMO algorithm.

A.76 Monitoring of subscriber profile sizes in UDM
==================================================

The subscriber profiles maintained by UDM have two parts - static and
dynamic data. Dynamic part of the subscriber profile grows over time
(e.g. due to roaming conditions, dynamic dereferencing of provisioning
data, addition/enabling of new features). The uncontrolled and unnoticed
growth of subscriber profiles may result in degraded system performance
and lead to service impacts.

Various corrective actions varying from subscriber profile optimization
(clean-up/compression/re-structuring) to applying configuration changes
and scaling may be applied to resolve/mitigate the issue.

Operators need to be aware of the subscriber profile size dynamics in
order to be able to mitigate potential network-wide problems before they
occur.

A.77 Monitoring of SS-RSRQ
==========================

SS-RSRQ is used in 5G NR networks to determine the quality of the radio
channel. RSRQ, unlike RSRP (wanted signal strength), also includes
interference level due to the inclusion of RSSI in calculation. This
measurement is usefule to eveluate the qulity of cell coverage through
the SS-RSRQ distribution,especially to optimize cell selection and
handover related parameters configration, mainly in border parts of
cell.

A.78 Monitoring of SS-SINR
==========================

SS-SINR is the ratio of the received signal level and the sum of
interference and noise, which is used in 5G NR networks to determine the
quality of the radio channel. This measurement is useful to eveluate the
QoS of Synchronization Signal through the SS-SINR distribution for each
cell. It is helpful to troubleshooting weak coverage cell or low NR
access rate cell according to the ratio of SS-SINR bins that is below
predefined threshold and all of the SS-SINR bins.

A.79 Monitoring of S-NSSAI availability update and notification
===============================================================

The S-NSSAI(s) supported by the AMF on a per TS basis may be changed and
the change needs be updated to NSSF. The AMF may subscribe to the
notification of any changes to the NSSAI availability information
updated by another AMF on a per TA basis.

The up-to-date and effective S-NSSAI availability information are
fundamental to support network slicing for 5G, therefore the performance
of S-NSSAI availability service needs to be monitored.

A.80 Monitoring of SMS delivery procedures
==========================================

SMS delivery is one of the essential procedures for SMS service. The
performance of SMS delivery procedures reflect the quality of SMS
service for users. The monitoring of SMS delivery request and success is
needed for SMS service evaluation.

A.81 Monitoring of registration and de-registration procedure for SMS
=====================================================================

In order to activate SMS service for a given service user, a
registration procedure for SMS over NAS is needed. Registration
procedure related measurements can reflect the success ratio for access
to 5GS of SMS users.

De-registration procedure is invoked to deactivate SMS service for a
given service user, which results in deleting an individual UE Context
for SMS in the SMSF. De-registration procedure related measurements can
reflect the success ratio for deactivating SMS service.

A.82 Monitoring of NIDD (Non-IP Data Delivery)
==============================================

NIDD service may be used to handle Mobile Originated (MO) and Mobile
Terminated (MT) communication with UEs to AF, where the data used for
the communication is considered unstructured (a.k.a., Non-IP).

NIDD is handled using an Unstructured PDU session to the NEF, and NIDD
API may be used for a PDU session based on the configuration in the
subscription.

The NIDD configuration service can be used for AF to update the NEF ID
for the NIDD service, and to indicate which serialization formats it
supports for mobile originated and mobile terminated traffic in the
Reliable Data Server Configuration.

Therefore, for evaluation of NIDD performance, the NIDD configuration
and NIDD service need to be monitored with the relevant performance
measurements.

A.83 Monitoring of AF traffic influence
=======================================

As described in TS 23.501 \[4\], an Application Function may send
requests to influence SMF routeing decisions for User Plane traffic of
PDU Sessions. The AF requests may influence UPF (re)selection and allow
routeing of user traffic to a local access (identified by a DNAI) to a
Data Network. The AF may request the traffic influence via NEF.

The fulfilment of traffic influence per the request from AF means that
the user data traffic is routed according to the requirements from the
application, therefore performance measurements are needed to indicate
whether the AF traffic influence requests are fulfilled.

A.84 Monitoring of external parameter provisioning
==================================================

The NEF allows an external party (AF) to provision the information, such
as expected UE behaviour (regarding UE movement or communication
characteristics) and service specific parameters, or the 5G VN (Virtual
Network) group information to 5G network functions, see TS 23.501 \[4\].

The failed external parameter provisioning would impact the UE behaviour
or service fulfilment; therefore, the performance of external parameter
provisioning needs to be monitored.

A.85 Monitoring of SMF-NEF connection establishment
===================================================

For delivering the NIDD service, the SMF-NEF connection needs to be
established for a PDU Session for a UE. NEF provides the capabilities to
create, update and release the SMF-NEF connection.

The SMF-NEF connection is used for transferring the NIDD data, therefore
the performance of the SMF-NEF connection establishment impacts users'
experience about the NIDD service.

A.86 Monitoring of service specific parameters provisioning
===========================================================

AF may need to provide service specific parameters to 5G system via NEF
in order to support the service not provided by the PLMN. The 5GS, after
receiving via NEF, delivers the service specific parameters to the
target UEs.

The service specific parameter provisioning service provided by NEF is
critical for the 5GS (including the UEs) to support these services.
Therefore, it would be necessary for the operators to monitor the
performance of the service specific parameter provisioning.

A.87 Monitoring of background data transfer policy negotiation and application
==============================================================================

AF may need to negotiate the policies for future background data
transfer with 5GS via NEF, before the UE's PDU Session establishment.
Per the request from AF, the NEF negotiates with H-PCF about the
transfer policies for the future background data transfer. The transfer
policies may contain a desired time window for the background data
transfer, a reference to a charging rate for the time window, network
area information, and optionally a maximum aggregated bitrate, as
described in clause 6.1.2.4 of TS 23.503 \[46\].

The AF may apply the negotiated policies for a future PDU Session at
some point.

The policies for the background data transfer have strong relevance to
users' experience, therefore the measurements are needed to monitor the
performance of policy negotiation and application for background data
transfer.

A.88 Monitoring of data management for UDR
==========================================

UDR provides data management services for the subscriber and application
related data, including:

\- Subscription Data,

\- Policy Data,

\- Structured Data for exposure,

\- Application data: Packet Flow Descriptions (PFDs) for application
detection and AF request information for multiple UEs;

\- NF Group ID corresponding to subscriber identifier (e.g. IMPI, IMPU,
SUPI).

The data management services provided by UDR allow to its consumer
(e.g., UDM, PCF and NEF) to read, create, update, delete a particular
set of data and subscribe/unsubscribe to notification of relevant data
changes.

Users' service may not be fulfilled due to a poorly performing (e.g.
overloaded) data management service, therefore it is indispensable that
the performance of data management services can be monitored.

A.89 Monitoring of background data transfer policy control
==========================================================

For background data transfer, AF may need to negotiate the policies for
with 5GS via NEF, and apply the negotiated policies for a future PDU
Session.

PCF provides the services for NEF to control the background data
transfer polices, including creation and update of the background data
transfer policies.

The fulfilment of background data transfer related services for the
users rely on background data transfer policy. Therefore it is necessary
to monitor the performance of background data transfer policy control.

A.90 Monitoring of AF session with QoS
======================================

To support a specific QoS requirements for an application, the AF may
provide the required QoS information when setting up the connection with
the UE. NEF offers the "AF session with QoS" service allowing the AF to
send the QoS information for the session, and then interacts with 5GC
NFs to apply the QoS requirements to the session.

If the 5GC fails to meet required QoS for an application for the UE, the
user’s experience is directly impacted. Therefore, the performance of
"AF session with QoS" needs to be monitored.

A.91 Monitoring of UCMF provisioning
====================================

The UCMF is used for storage of dictionary entries corresponding to
either PLMN-assigned or Manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability IDs.

Provisioning of Manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID entries in
the UCMF is performed from an AF that interacts with the UCMF either
directly or via the NEF.

Knowing the UE radio capabilities is critical for the 5G system to
provide the appropriate control for the UE, missing the UE radio
capabilities may cause discretional control for the UEs thus result in
failures or performance degradation. Therefore, the performance
measurements are needed to assess the performance of UCMF provisioning.

A.92 Monitoring of Time-domain average Maximum Scheduled Layer Number for MIMO scenario
=======================================================================================

The Time-domain average maximum scheduled layer number for MIMO scenario
measurement could provide operators the scheduled layer number, the
actural spatial capability of a cell under MIMO scenario and can help
operators to calculate the radio resource untilization rate.

A.93 Monitoring of Average value of scheduled MIMO layers per PRB
=================================================================

> The average value of scheduled MIMO layers per PRB should be
> monitored, as it reflects the capacity improvement brought by MIMO in
> the 5G business network, quantitatively. The operators can use this
> information to compare cell capacity among different areas and support
> capacity enhancement decision-making. Besides, the information can be
> used to optimize the MIMO equipment performance and other OAM works.

A.94 Monitoring of policy authorization
=======================================

To ensure the 5GS has proper AM and SM polices supporting an external
application, the AF may need to query, create, or change the AM and SM
policies for a UE in the 5GS.

The PCF may authorize the AF to, directly or indirectly via NEF, query,
create or change the AM and SM policies.

The performance of AM and SM policy management authorization to AF may
directly impact the user’s experience when using the subject
applications, therefore the policy authorization needs to be monitored.

A.95 Monitoring of event exposure
=================================

An NF (e.g., NEF or NWDAF) may need to subscribe and get notified about
PCF events for a group of UE(s) or any UE accessing a combination of
(DNN, S-NSSAI).

The events can be subscribed by a NF consumer from PCF are described in
clause 6.1.3.18 of TS 23.503 \[46\].

The NF consumer may use the events exposed by PCF for controlling the
UE, hence the performance of event exposure needs to be monitored.

A.96 Monitoring of PRB Usage for MIMO in NG-RAN
===============================================

The PRB Usage for MIMO with dynamic factor measurement could provide
operators the load information of radio network in MIMO scenario taking
spatial resource into consideration. In the early stage of network
development, the measurements with a dynamic spatial factor can reflect
the actual frequency and space resource utilization of a cell after
MU-MIMO is activated. In the late stage of network development, the
measurements can help operators be aware of whether a cell has
experienced high load.

The SDM PDSCH/PUSCH PRB Usage considers all subscribers’ MIMO layers in
a cell. Correspondingly, it is based on the average value of all
scheduled MIMO layers. When subscribers in a cell spread over (e.g.
distribute randomly), operators can use SDM PDSCH/PUSCH PRB Usage to
evaluate the usage of cell capacity in this scenario.

A.97 Monitoring of subscriber data management at UDM
====================================================

The subscribe data are managed in UDM, and provided to other consumer
NFs (e.g., AMF, SMF, SMSF, NEF, and 5G DDNMF, etc) in 5GS to provide the
network services to the users. The subscriber data management in UDM
allows some consumer NFs to get the subscriber data, and some consumer
NFs to subscribe to the notifications of the updates of the subscriber
data. It is important to monitor the performance of the subscriber data
management.

A.98 Monitoring of parameter provisioning at UDM
================================================

The UDM allows provision, by the consumer NF (e.g., NEF), of information
which can be used for the UE in 5GS, such as expected UE behaviour
(regarding UE movement or communication characteristics) and service
specific parameters, or the 5G VN (Virtual Network) group information to
5G network functions, see TS 23.501 \[4\].

The failed parameter provisioning would impact the UE behaviour or
service fulfilment; therefore, it is needed to monitor the performance
of parameter provisioning.

A.99 Use case of measurements for ECS.
======================================

ECS related measurements are used to measure the performance of an ECS
on each of the supported functionality.

The EES Registration procedure allows an EES to provide its information
to an ECS to be used during service provisioning. It is useful to
analyse the EES registration success rate in order to assess ECS
performance. If the failure rate increases beyond a defined threshold,
corrective actions can be taken by the OAM systems. Hence, it is
necessary to collect measurement related with EES Registration
procedures.

A.100 Use case of measurements for EES
======================================

EES related measurements are used to measure the performance of an EES
on each of the supported functionality.

Discovery procedures enable entities in an edge deployment to obtain
information about EAS and their available services, based on specified
criteria of interest. It is useful to analyse the EAS discovery success
rate in order to assess EES performance. The discovery procedure may
fail due to the unavailability of the relavant EAS. If the number of
failures within a time period increases beyond a defined threshold,
corrective actions (e.g instantiating the required EAS instance(s) in an
appropriate EDN) can be taken by MnS consumer (e.g. ASP). Hence, it is
necessary to collect measurement related with EAS discovery procedures.
EAS discovery failure measurement can be used to mitigate the EAS
discovery failure issue, based on the UE locations, application
characteristics, and number of EAS discovery failures.

An EEC performs registration, registration update, and de-registration
with an EES in order to provide information that can be used by the EES
in Edge Computing services. It is useful to analyse the success rate of
registration, registration update, and de-registration in order to
assess EES performance. If the number of failures within a time period
increases beyond a defined threshold, corrective actions can be taken by
the OAM systems. Hence, it is necessary to collect measurement related
with EEC registration, registration update, and de-registration
procedures.

The EAS Registration procedure allows an EAS to provide its information
to an EES in order to enable its discovery. It is useful to analyse the
EAS registration success rate in order to assess EES performance. If the
number of failures within a time period increases beyond a defined
threshold, corrective actions can be taken by the OAM systems. Hence, it
is necessary to collect measurement related with EAS Registration
procedures.

A.101 Monitoring of location management
=======================================

The UE location is required for various purposes, e.g., location-based
applications, lawful interception, emergency calls, as well as the
positioning services, etc.

The LMF manages the overall co-ordination and scheduling of resources
required for the location of a UE for 5G. It also calculates or verifies
a final location and any velocity estimate and may estimate the achieved
accuracy. The LMF determine the result of the positioning in
geographical co-ordinates.

The LMF provides location management related NF services (such as
location determination, location notification, and location context
transfer) in order for the consumer to get the location of the UEs.
Therefore, the performance of location management related NF services
need to be monitored in order to evaluate whether it can fulfil the
consumer’s requirements, and to figure out the causes for the failures
to derive the remedy solutions.

A.102 Monitoring of DRBs undergoing GTP User Plane Path failures
================================================================

The DRB setup procedure in NG-RAN is to assign resources in gNB and on
the air interface (Uu) for one or several DRBs that will handle the QoS
flows requested to setup by the core network. The gNB may map several
QoS flows to the same DRB so there is no one-to-one mapping between the
flows and DRBs.

At DRB setup, the gNB will handle all QoS flows mapped to one DRB the
same (mapped 5QI). A QoS flow that is at a later stage mapped to an
already setup existing DRB will not increment the DRB setup counters.

The DRB setup is one of the most key procedures to allocate resources in
the NG-RAN to the UE per the QoS requirements. Whether or not the DRB is
successfully setup has direct impact to the user experience. A failed
DRB setup may directly cause service failure or degradation for an end
user. So, the performance related to the DRB setup for the gNB needs to
be monitored per supported mapped 5QI and per S-NSSAI.

During transient path failures (e.g. path failures not exceeding few
minutes at most), maintaining the PDU session contexts associated with
the peer's IP address enables the delivery of end user services (when
the path is re-established again) and this also avoids unnecessary
signalling in the network for restoring those PDU sessions.  
It is not intended to maintain PDU session contexts during long path
failures (e.g. exceeding few minutes at most) as this would imply
undesirable effects like undue charging.

The total number of active transient path failures irrespective of
whether this path restores into PDU session or not is measured with this
use case.

A.103 Use case of measurements for ECS.
=======================================

ECS related measurements are used to measure the performance of an ECS
on each of the supported functionality.

Service provisioning procedures enable EEC to discover the available
edge service. It is useful to analyse the service provisioning success
rate in order to assess ECS performance. The provisionig procedure may
fail due to the unavailability of the relavant EES. If the failure rate
increases beyond a defined threshold, corrective actions (e.g
instantiating the required EES) can be taken by the OAM systems. Hence,
it is necessary to collect measurement related with service provisioning
procedures.

A.104 Use case of UL remote interference identification
=======================================================

When atmospheric ducting phenomenon happens, radio signals can travel a
relatively long distance, and the propagation delay goes beyond the gap.
In this case, the downlink signals of an aggressor base station can
travel a long distance and interfere with the uplink signals of a victim
base station that is far away from the aggressor. Such interference is
termed as 'remote interference'. When it happens, the IoT of the victim
base station demonstrates a "sloping" characteristic, the closer the
uplink symbol is to gap, the higher interference it experienced. The
reason behind this is that, the remote interference is caused by
accumulated signals from a number of remote base stations with different
distances.

This type of interference affects the effective reception of SRSs,
resulting in a series of problems affecting user experience, such as
call drops, access failures, and low rates. Therefore, some related
measurements, such as GP symbol interference, SRS symbol interference
and PUSCH symbol interference measurement, are needed to monitor/detect
remote interference.

A.105 Monitoring of UE throughput per BWP in NG-RAN
===================================================

UE throughput is one of the key indicators to reflect cell quality.
Keeping track of UE throughput in NG-RAN is helpful for cell
configurations and features scheduling to ensure user satisfaction and
network performance.

With Bandwidth Adaptation (BA), the receive and transmit bandwidth of a
UE needs not to be as large as the bandwidth of the cell and can be
adjusted (e.g., to shrink the bandwidth during the period of low
activity to save power). A subset of the total cell bandwidth is
referred to as a Bandwidth Part (BWP) and BA is achieved by configuring
the UE with BWP(s) and telling the UE which of the configured BWPs is
currently the active one. The value of the activated BWP of the UE will
affect the UE throughput and thus the cell throughput. The larger BWP is
activated, the higher the throughput will achieve.

When monitoring the quality of a cell with a 100MHz bandwidth, in case
that all UEs are activated with 100 MHz BWP, it is reasonable to
consider the cell as a poor-quality cell if the UE throughput is lower
than a fixed threshold. However, when small bandwidth BWP is activated,
for example, to save power, some UEs in the cell are activated with 20
MHz Dedicated BWP, other UEs are activated with 100Mhz Dedicated BWP,
the previous fixed threshold for judging poor-quality cell is not
applicable since peak throughput of some users is limited by the small
active BWP. In this case, the UE throughput per BWP needs to be
considered to set the proper threshold, so as to correctly estimate
whether the cell quality is poor or not. Therefore, measurements and
monitoring of UE throughput per BWP are needed.

A.106 Monitoring of available MIMO layers coverage map per UE and per PRB
=========================================================================

The Available MIMO Layers Coverage Map per UE and per PRB should be
monitored, as it reflects possible improvement brought by MIMO with the
increased number of layers in the 5G business network. The operators can
use this information to monitor what may be the limitations from the
number of assigned layers per UE and PRB in the observed cell based on
UE distance from the base station. Besides, filling up the bins of the
Available MIMO Layers Coverage Map with the number of scheduled PRBs of
the UE on distance from the base station falling into the given bin may
provide the information that may be used to optimize the MIMO equipment
performance and other OAM works.

A.107 Use case of monitoring of MA PDU session management for ATSSS
===================================================================

The ATSSS feature enables a multi-access PDU Connectivity Service, which
can exchange PDUs between the UE and a data network by simultaneously
using one 3GPP access network and one non-3GPP access network. The
multi-access PDU Connectivity Service is realized by a Multi-Access PDU
(MA PDU) Session.

When establishing an MA PDU session, the AMF informs the SMF that the
request is for a MA PDU Session. The number and success rate of MA PDU
session creations, and the number of MA PDU sessions running on the SMF
are some of the basic performance measurements for monitoring the
performance of MA PDU session establishment and reflecting the effect of
ATSSS. And the failed MA PDU session creations measured per cause are
helpful to pinpoint and solve the network issues in case the performance
is below the expectation.

When an ATSSS-capable UE requests to establish a single-access PDU
Session, but no policy in the UE and no local restrictions mandate a
single access, the 5GC network may decide to modify it to a Multi-Access
PDU (MA PDU) Session. This decision may be taken when e.g. the SMF wants
to offload some traffic of the requested PDU Session to non-3GPP access
or when the SMF wants to apply MPTCP and/or MPQUIC to provide bandwidth
aggregation for the requested PDU Session(see TS 23.502 \[7\]). Whether
a requested PDU Session can be successful converted to a MA PDU Session
by the network may help the analysis and update of ATSSS policy.
Therefore the performance of UE requested PDU session establishment with
network modification to MA PDU session procedures need to be monitored.

A.108 Use case of cross link interference identification
========================================================

When different TDD DL/UL patterns are used between neighbouring cells,
UL transmission in one cell may interfere with DL reception in another
cell: this is referred to as Cross Link Interference (CLI).

The measurements of SRS-RSRP reported by UEs is a useful metric
reflecting interference strength. This measurement is usefule to
optimize DL/UL subframe pattern through the SRS-RSRP distribution and to
mitigate CLI.

A.109 Monitoring of NWDAF providing analytics service information
=================================================================

NWDAF service consumers may have requirements on the time consumed by
NWDAF to provide analytics information. In such cases, the analytics
information provided by the NWDAF may be time sensitive, and the
consumers may expect to receive the analytics information before a
specific time. Therefore, the time consumption of NWDAF providing the
requested service is an important factor that reflects the NWDAF service
performance. It is important in decision-making for management of NWDAF.

The time taken by NWDAF to provide analytics information needs to be
monitored. This measurement reflects how much time is consumed by an
NWDAF to prepare and provide the analytics information. The analytics
type is identified by Analytics ID (see TS 23.288 \[59\]). The time
consumption related to different types of analytics needs to be
monitored respectively to know the performance of NWDAF when providing
different analytics. With these measurements, operators can analyse and
evaluate the performance of the NWDAF and make correct decisions on
whether they need to take management actions to optimize the NWDAF
service performance.

A.110 Monitoring of coordination between multiple NWDAFs
========================================================

In the multiple NWDAFs deployment scenario, the NWDAF is able to act as
an Aggregator NWDAF (i.e. the NWDAF with analytics aggregation
capability). In the case where an NWDAF service consumer requests
Analytics ID(s) that requires multiple NWDAFs to collectively serve the
request, the Aggregator NWDAF may act as the analytics service consumer
to request the analytics information from other NWDAFs. After collecting
analytics information from other NWDAFs, the Aggregator NWDAF may act as
the analytics service producer to provide the aggregated analytics
information.

The coordination between multiple NWDAFs may directly impact the
performance of service provided by the Aggregator NWDAF and resource
management between multiple NWDAFs. Therefore, the measurements related
to the coordination between multiple NWDAFs are needed to reflect the
performance of NWDAF service. These measurements are important in
decision-making for the management of NWDAF.

The number of SBA interaction activities needs to be monitored. It
reflects how many NFs the Aggregator NWDAF coordinates with and how busy
the Aggregator NWDAF is on aggregation operation. The SBA interaction
activity may include the subscription, request, notification and
response received and/or generated by Aggregator NWDAF (see TS 23.288
\[59\]). In order to know the performance of Aggregator NWDAF when
providing different types of services to the consumers, the number of
SBA interaction activities related to different types of analytics need
to be monitored respectively. The analytics type is identified by
Analytics ID (see TS 23.288 \[59\]).

The measurements described above are some of the basic statistic
information to monitor the performance of Aggregator NWDAF on
coordination with other NWDAFs. Operators can use this statistic
information to analyse and evaluate the performance of multiple
Aggregator NWDAF, and make configuration and resource allocation among
multiple NWDAFs.

A.111 Monitoring of NWDAF service provisioning
==============================================

The NWDAF can provide different services on demand of NWDAF service
consumers (e.g. NFs/OAM), including analytics service, ML model
provisioning service and data management service, etc. In the case that
NWDAF supports logical decomposition, the NWDAF can be decomposed into
Analytics logical function (AnLF) and Model Training logical function
(MTLF). The NWDAF may contain the AnLF only, contain MTLF only, or
contain both AnLF and MTLF. NWDAFs containing different logical
functions support different services.

The performance of NWDAF on service provisioning directly impacts the
service experience of the NWDAF service consumers. The service
provisioning related measurements are needed to reflect the performance
of the NWDAF. In order to know the performance of NWDAF in terms of
providing different services to the consumers, the different services
provided by NWDAF or NWDAF with different logical functions need to be
monitored respectively. These measurements are important in
decision-making for the management of NWDAF.

The NWDAF follows the service-based architecture (SBA). The number of
SBA interaction activities related to the specific NWDAF service need to
be monitored as it reflects how busy the NWDAF is on the specific
service provisioning. The SBA interaction activity between the NWDAF and
NWDAF service consumer may include the subscription, request,
notification and response received and/or generated by NWDAF (see TS
23.288 \[59\]).

The number of subscriptions, requests, notifications and responses are
some of the basic statistic information to monitor the performance of
NWDAF on specific service provisioning. These basic measurements can be
used to derive the other performance of NWDAF such as service successful
and/or failed rate, etc. With these measurements, operators can analyse
and evaluate the performance of the NWDAF. Operators can use these
measurements to take management actions for configuration, resource
allocation or load balance purpose.

A.112 Monitoring of NWDAF service failure
=========================================

The NWDAF can provide services on demand of NWDAF service consumers. For
example, the consumers of analytics service may indicate to the NWDAF
the latest time that they expect to receive the requested analytics
information. This time can be specified by "Time when analytics
information is needed".

The "Time when analytics information is needed" will not be set to a
value less than the "Supported Analytics Delay" specified in the NWDAF
profile. Otherwise, it means that the time parameters are misconfigured.
In that case, the NWDAF may not be able to provide the requested service
in time. Meanwhile, if the "Time when analytics information is needed"
is reached but the analytics information is not available, the NWDAF may
send an error response or error notification to the consumer.

Moreover, the "Time when Analytics is delivered to the consumer" will
not be greater than the "Time when analytics information is needed".
Otherwise, it means that the NWDAF delivers the requested analytics
information too late. And the "Time when Analytics is delivered to the
consumer" will not be greater than the "Supported Analytics Delay".
Otherwise, it means that the NWDAF generates the requested analytics
information too late.

Similarly, the consumers of ML model training service, e.g., FL server
NWDAF, may indicate to the FL client NWDAF the maximum response time
that they expect to receive the requested ML model training information.
This time can be specified by "Maximum response time”. If the maximum
response time is violated, the consumers of ML model training service,
e.g., FL server NWDAF, may indicate to the FL client NWDAF an extended
maximum response time that they expect to receive the requested ML model
training information. This time can be specified by “Extended maximum
response time”.

The "Time when ML model training information is delivered to the
consumer” will not be greater than the “Maximum response time”.
Otherwise, it means that the NWDAF delivers the requested ML model
training information too late. In that case, the “Time when ML model
training information is delivered to the consumer” will not be greater
than the “Extended maximum response time”. Otherwise, it means that the
NWDAF cannot deliver the requested ML model training information and may
send an error response or error notification to the consumer.

Keeping track of events described above is needed to reflect the
performance of NWDAF on service failure aspect, which includes tracking
the number of events for time misconfiguration, the number of analytics
events for late delivery and the number of events for late analytics
generating, number of ML model training information events delivery,
etc. These measurements reflect how many or how often the NWDAF service
errors happen in various cases. It is important in decision-making for
the management of NWDAF. With these measurements, the operators are able
to understand the working status of the NWDAF instance under monitoring
and make correct decisions on whether they need to take the management
actions to solve the problem or to optimize the situation.

A.113 Use case of measurements for 5G LAN-type services.
========================================================

5G LAN-type services-related measurements are used to measure the
performance of 5G LAN-type services on each of the supported
functionality.

The performance of 5G LAN-type services needs to be monitored on the 5G
VN group level by the operator since it is relevant to whether the end
users can use the service of 5G LAN and scale up/down a 5G VN based on
the capacity for efficient consumption of network resources.

The performance measurement of 5G LAN-type services may include the
measurements of 5G VN group status, the number of subscribers in 5G VN
groups, and the duration of 5G VN group communication which information
can be gathered from NFs supporting 5G LAN-type services.

The 5G VN group performance measurement would impact end-user experience
and service fulfillment, hence, measurements and monitoring of 5G
LAN-type services are needed.

A.114 Monitoring of NWDAF data collection
=========================================

The Data Collection feature permits NWDAF to retrieve data from various
data sources, which can be NF such as AMF, SMF, PCF, UDM, AF, UPF or
OAM, as a basis of network analytics (See TS 23.288 \[59\]). Data
Collection related measurements, such as the amount and the frequency of
the data collection from different data sources, can be used to optimize
the deployment of NWDAF and improve the other services provided by
NWDAF. For example, based on the Data Collection related measurements,
the NWDAF instance may be recommended to be geographically deployed
closer to its major data source to reduce the latency and save network
resources.

Therefore, the Data Collection related measurements are important
factors that reflect the NWDAF Data Collection performance. Since the
Data Source and the services used are different, the measurements
related to different data sources need to be monitored respectively. By
monitoring the number of subscriptions/notifications for Data Collection
services in a period, the operators can know how often the NWDAF
collects data from the same data source and the differences from
different data sources . These measurements can be used to infer the
performance of NWDAF on data collection.

A.115 Inter SN CPC preparation related measurements
===================================================

The SCG mobility is extended to Conditional PSCell Change (CPC). In case
of CPC Execution to wrong PSCell related to SN initiated inter- SN CPC
the root cause can be on Source SN (S-SN), target SN (T-SN) or in MN
side.

For SN initiated inter-SN CPC the Master Node (MN) inttiates SN Addition
procedure to each candidate T-SN to prepare the list of candidate
PSCells selected by the S-SN. After that MN provides CPC configuration
to UE. For fast moving UEs when due to extensive delay in configuring
the CPC to UE the list of candidate PSCells selected by the S-SN may be
outdated.

For proper identification of an issue in MN side it is important to
measure "Average Time Interval for Preparation of the SN initiated
inter-SN CPC" to optimize the list of candidate PSCells in S-SN.

A.116 Monitoring of machine learning model provisioning at NWDAF
================================================================

The NWDAF containing Model Training Logical Function (MTLF) can train
Machine Learning (ML) models and provides ML model provisioning service.

From operators' point of view, in most of the cases, the model
provisioning services provided by NWDAF are based on the implementation.
It may not be feasible to identify the internal working procedure of
NWDAF related to the ML model provisioning services. However, it is
possible to monitor the overall time consumed by the NWDAF on model
provisioning services.

If it is measured that the overall time consumed by the NWDAF to
response the model provisioning services request exceeds a time length
threshold which is provided based on experience, it may indicate that
the NWDAF is requesting, using or calling for more resource to perform
model provisioning related operations, for example, model training, and
the amount of resource or the workload of NWDAF exceeds certain level,
and they are not negligible. As a result, the performance can be
estimated based on this measurement.

Moreover, based on the deployment, if the NWDAF instance is able to
perform the model training, with the help of the smart classifying
criteria used as the threshold, it is also possible to detect the model
training and it is even possible to estimate the number of the model
training performed by NWDAF with acceptable accuracy.

The ML model trained by NWDAF is available for one or more Analytics
ID(s) (see TS 23.288 \[59\]). There, the time consumption of model
provisioning services can be further associated with the Analytics IDs
based on the model used to provide the analytic report.

Monitoring of machine learning model provisioning at NWDAF is essential
for the management of NWDAF. Operators can use these measurements for
configuration, resource allocation or load balance purpose related to
the management of NWDAF.

A.117 Monitoring of ML models in NWDAF
======================================

NWDAF containing Model Training Logical Function (MTLF) can train ML
models for a particular analytics ID (specified in \[59\]) based on the
request from multiple training consumers. NWDAF Analytics Logical
Function (AnLF) can deploy trained ML models for generating analytics
based on the request from multiple analytics consumers. Considering that
the NWDAF AnLF may host several ML models for generating analytics for
multiple analytics IDs at the same time, there is a need for monitoring
the usage of ML models deployed in NWDAF AnLF as it reflects the service
load of the NWDAF AnLF. The operators can use this information for
resource optimization or load balancing of NWDAF AnLF.
